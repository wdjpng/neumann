    <p>Dear Professor,</p>

    <p>
    I am turning to you with a request, hoping that it will not cause you any substantial inconvenience.  It concerns the assistantship at the <u>theoretical</u> physics chair of the University of Berlin, which is awarded every three years and, so I am informed, will again become vacant this coming autumn.  Since it seems highly probable that Prof.&nbsp;Schrödinger will come to Berlin, it would be the assistantship under him, and I believe I am not mistaken in assuming that he will fill the post within the next few months.
    </p>

    <p>
    During my recent time in Göttingen I have worked a great deal—indeed almost exclusively—on quantum mechanics, and I therefore hope that I may count myself among those considered for this position.
    </p>

    <p>
    If I am not mistaken, Prof.&nbsp;Schrödinger is presently in Zürich; I would therefore be most grateful, Professor, if you would be so kind as to discuss the matter with him in this sense—especially as you are familiar with my scientific work and interests.  I hope that this request will not cause you any particular trouble and thank you in advance.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since, in your last letter, you kindly invited me to inform you about my work on occasion, I have taken the liberty of adding a few remarks on a question with which I have been occupied—following on from the quantum-mechanical operator calculus—and which, I believe, I have brought to a certain conclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
    The question is that of formulating and settling the eigenvalue problem for general (in particular, unbounded!) symmetric operators in the sense in which Hilbert succeeded for the bounded ones (for quantum mechanics it is precisely the unbounded operators that are of greatest interest).  Thus arbitrary symmetric operators are admitted—the operators may act on the points of Hilbert space (i.e. they are infinite matrices) or on functions (the spaces of functions are isomorphic to Hilbert space), differential operators being allowed in the appropriate sense.
    </p>

    <p>
    One cannot demand that they be meaningful everywhere (a brief consideration shows this to be the case only for the bounded ones); instead one requires that the operator be maximally symmetric, i.e. that there exist no symmetric operator which is defined everywhere the given one is, agrees with it there, and is also defined at additional points.
    </p>

    <p>
    I define an eigenvalue representation as follows: \(E(\lambda)\;(-\infty<\lambda<\infty)\) is a family of projection operators, \(E(\lambda)\) increases monotonically with \(\lambda\), tends to \(0\) and \(1\) respectively as \(\lambda\to\pm\infty\) (i.e. \(E(\lambda)f\) tends <i>en&nbsp;moyenne</i> to \(0\) or \(f\)), and is continuous from the right nowhere else.  — My terminology is the same as in my quantum-mechanical manuscript.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let \(Q(f,g)\) be the scalar product of \(f\) and \(g\) (in Hilbert space \(\sum f_n g_n\); in function spaces \(\int f\,g\,dv\)); let \(Q(f,f)=Qf\).  
    </p>

    <p>
    If
    \[
        \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \lambda^{2}\, dQ\!\bigl(E(\lambda)f\bigr)
    \]
    is finite, then there exists one and only one \(f^{*}\) (with finite \(Q(f^{*})\)) such that for all \(g\)
    \[
        Q\!\bigl(f^{*},g\bigr)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\varphi\bigl(f,E(\lambda)g\bigr).
    \]
    The operator \(T^{*}\) corresponding to these \(E(\lambda)\) is then defined on such \(f\) by \(T^{*}f=f^{*}\) (symbolically  
    \[
        T^{*}= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \lambda\, dE(\lambda)
    \]
    ), which is once again merely Hilbert’s definition of the eigenvalue problem.
    </p>

    <p>
    One can now prove the following: if \(E(\lambda)\) is a family of single operators with the properties just stated, the corresponding operator \(T^{*}\) is maximally symmetric.  Conversely, for every maximally symmetric operator \(T_{0}\) there exists one and only one such family for which \(T_{0}\) is the corresponding operator.
    </p>

    <p>
    The theorem is, incidentally, rather difficult to prove; even assuming all formalities and known results, I cannot compress the proof into fewer than 25–30 printed pages.  It will appear in the <i>Mathematische Annalen</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Apologising once more for the trouble caused, I remain, yours most respectfully,
    </p>
