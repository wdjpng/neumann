Dear Professor,  

Many thanks for your letter; I shall be in Hamburg over the summer.  
My address is Heimhüdenstr.&nbsp;18.  

Your paper on the spinning electron will interest me greatly;  
I assume Scheel is to send it to me, or have you arranged otherwise?  

My work on a treatment of Dirac’s equation without teleparallelism  
leads to the conclusion that it should be written in a general-relativistic form: 
    </div>

    <div class="handwritten math-block">
\[
\Bigl( \sum_{\mu} \beta_{\mu}\!\left(p_{\mu} + \frac{e}{c}\,\varphi_{\mu}\right) + m\,c\,i \Bigr)\,\psi = 0,
\]
\[
\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{\nu} + \gamma_{\nu}\gamma_{\mu} \;=\; 2\,g_{\mu\nu},
\]
    </div>

    <div class="handwritten">
where the relativistic field equations hold for the \(g_{\mu\nu}\),  
so that the commutation relations of \(\gamma_{\mu}\) and \(p_{\mu}\) are now known;  

whereas, in the sense of the distant-parallel theory  
\(j_n = h a_n \bar{J}_a\) (with \(J_1,\dots ,J_4\) the <u>constant</u> Dirac matrices!),  
the Dirac field equations supply the desired commutation relations.  

Incidentally, the new Einstein theory is completely obscure,  
since one does not know the fields; the fourth version  
(which annuls the previous three) is now appearing,  
and there may be any number of further ones.  
Do you really believe the world is that complicated—  
all the more as electrodynamics has never been observed on astronomical scales  
and gravitation on atomic scales? —  

I like Mr Stoner’s result very much as well.  
Meanwhile I have written a paper in which, among other things,  
I prove that any set of mutually commuting Hermitian operators  
can always be regarded as functions of a single one  
which itself is a function*1 of them.  

I can also carry through the theory of normality and intelligibility  
in bounded form quite easily.  
Furthermore, if there is a set of hom. operators comprising  
“all hom. op.” commuting with every element of \(X\),  
then it consists precisely of the functions of the elements of \(X\).*2  

Quite recently I have been pondering how the ergodic theorem  
in quantum mechanics can be proved without “ordering assumptions,”  
and on which assumptions it depends which functions  
are characteristic for its validity.  
We also succeed in specifying the quantum-mechanical analogue  
of Gibbs’ phase space (which you have christened “uncertainty relations”). —  

I have taken leave to Hamburg for the summer  
so that I may return to Berlin in the winter.  
After Schorie’s move to Rostock I could have got the professorship more easily,  
yet under these circumstances I definitely cannot resolve to leave Berlin. —  

I hope it will not be too long before I have the opportunity to see you again.  
Until then, with my best regards and with the request  
that you convey my hand-kisses to your wife,  

Yours most devoted  

J.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Neumann.
