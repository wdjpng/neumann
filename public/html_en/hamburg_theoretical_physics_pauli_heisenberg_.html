        <p>Dear Professor,</p>

        <p>Please excuse me for replying to your two letters only now; in the meantime I spent several weeks in Budapest because my father unexpectedly died last month of an “ileus”. —</p>

        <p>Since you told me that you had also sent your questions and amendments directly to Schuel, I have taken no further steps in that matter.</p>

        <p>Your paper interested me greatly and has in fact convinced me that the Dirac equation can be brought into harmony with the ordinary general theory of relativity.</p>

        <p>My earlier misgiving about Heisenberg’s programme referred solely to the fact that it cannot exist in a purely mechanical fashion without your new formal approach.</p>

        <p>What is the situation regarding the four-component theory? Have you read Pauli–Heisenberg’s paper? Owing to the inherited vice of both Lorentz and relativity theory it seems to pass by the essence of the exmentar process, yet it is impressive that it is strictly relativistic and never collides with the transformation theory! What do you think of it? —</p>

        <p>Eight weeks ago I negotiated here with Prof.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Murnaghan of Baltimore, who wanted to “import” Europeans to Johns Hopkins; he offered me an associate position at $3,000 per year, at first for one year. I did not consider it very advantageous and later declined—also because of my father’s death. Murnaghan now offers me the same position from 1 February to 1 June with $1,500 for those four months. I would actually like such a short trip to America, yet the offer still does not seem materially favourable enough.</p>

        <p>I should be very grateful if, on the basis of your American experience, you would tell me whether I am right, or rather how the matter is to be evaluated.</p>

        <p>Will you still be in Princeton in the spring of 1930? —</p>

        <p>In the hope of seeing you again, with best regards</p>

        <p><em>*dit option on my part to stay.</em></p>

        <p>and, at your wife’s request to convey my thanks to you, I remain yours very faithfully</p>

        <p>J.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Neumann.<br>
        (from&nbsp;1&nbsp;Aug.&nbsp;on Budapest-Stráß-…)</p>
