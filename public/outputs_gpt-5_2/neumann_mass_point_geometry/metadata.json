  "summary": "Von Neumann presents his solution for representing the effect of a mass point on de Sitter's hyperbolic world, deriving the line element and transformation equations that map the space onto a de Sitter hyperboloid. He discusses the regularity of this hyperbolic world outside neighborhoods of the mass point and its antipode, and explores the philosophical implications of antipodal symmetry for causality and time direction.",
