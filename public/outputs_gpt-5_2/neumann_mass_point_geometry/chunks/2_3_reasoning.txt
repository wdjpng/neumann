**Considering MathJax Implementation**

I need to represent mathematical expressions using MathJax, specifically formatting them as \(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\) and including negatives with minus signs and subscripts. It seems I should embed these expressions in html using MathJax markup. I think I’ll include a small script tag for loading MathJax v3, as the instruction suggests I focus on making it visually appealing. I also want to ensure that line breaks are preserved while outputting just the HTML code.
**Designing Note with Math Integration**

I want to incorporate math within a styled container, ideally using `<pre>` and ensuring MathJax processes the expressions like \(x_1\). However, I’m considering using `<p>` lines and `<span>` for better control. For the note's appearance, a parchment background could work, keeping it simple. 

I’ll style "P.S." with a space after the dot, using `<h2 class="ps">P. S.</h2>`. The text includes a German phrase that needs to be accurately rendered, with attention to spacing and line breaks as well.
**Formatting the Note**

I want to divide the text into two lines, each wrapping in a `<p>` tag. The first line reads, "Ich weiß nicht wie die Symmetrie der Antipoden zu deuten ist," and the second line says, "Die radikalste Lösung wäre stets zwei Antipoden \(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\) und \(-x_1, -x_2, -x_3, -x_4\) zu identifizieren." I need to focus on making it visually appealing, perhaps using a handwriting-style font, adjusting margins, line-height, and letter spacing while keeping the layout neatly aligned to the left, with a light paper background color.
**Compiling HTML Structure**

I'm ensuring that I only output HTML code, so including the DOCTYPE and full HTML skeleton seems necessary. I want to include the line "Ich weiß nicht..." across two lines, and based on the screenshot, there seem to be three lines, excluding "P.S." I will create a `<main>` container that looks like a handwritten letter, setting a width of 900 px with some padding. I’ll also incorporate a script to load MathJax for rendering my mathematical expressions cleanly. Finally, I’ll compile everything into pure HTML as requested.
