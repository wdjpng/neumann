**Interpreting German handwriting**

I need to OCR some German handwriting that contains mathematical equations, and I'll be using MathJax for formatting. I want to ignore any partially cut-off lines. The handwriting starts with something like "Wenn 0 < m < 1/(3√3)," which leads into an equation involving a polynomial. I’m unsure about some terms, like “1 reëale” or “1 negative.” Overall, it looks like there are two positive roots and one negative root for the polynomial. It's a bit confusing, but I'm piecing it together!
**Analyzing the handwritten text**

I'm closely examining the second line, which mentions "sind 2 positive Wurzeln r-1, r0, r1," likely referring to roots of a polynomial with r0 and r1 being positive and r-1 as negative. Then it continues with a phrase that could translate to “this solution is useful.” The following line seems to begin with something like "Mit der Transformation," which implies a transformation process. I’m piecing together that the text is about polynomial roots and their implications in a mathematical context!
**Preparing the HTML output**

I’m starting to format the text into HTML, aiming for a cursive style while keeping the original line breaks intact. I'll use MathJax for rendering equations, applying inline formatting. I'm thinking of chunking the text properly while ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The first complete line begins with "Wenn 0 < m < 1/(3√3)," and I need to maintain the hyphenation from the handwritten notes, so it reads "nega-" followed by "tiv" in the next line. The second line starts with "tiv und 2 positive Wurzeln r_{-1}, r_0, r_1."
**Crafting the HTML with MathJax**

I’m gathering the next lines of text: line three states “ist dann diese Lösung brauchbar” and line four begins with “Mit der Transformation.” I need to write everything in the HTML, including the MathJax script since they requested that. I'll ensure the equations are neatly presented using the specified styles, focusing on a monospaced font for clarity. 

The first equation reads, "Wenn 0<m<1/(3√3) ist so hat \(1-\frac{2m}{r}-r^2\) 1 nega-," and I’m keeping it as is. The second line follows with "tiv und 2 positive Wurzeln \(r_{-1}, r_0, r_1\). Für \(r_0<r<r_1\)," which fits perfectly.
**Creating the HTML structure**

I'm going to produce HTML that mimics a preformatted style by using `<div class="page">` for the main container and `<p>` tags for each line with `<br>` to ensure proper line breaks. Adding some italics will give it that handwritten feel, as requested. I’ll incorporate CSS to style it with a letter-like font while keeping the design minimal and visually appealing. It’s important to make it pretty and maintain a user-friendly look, so I’ll focus on that as I build it out!
