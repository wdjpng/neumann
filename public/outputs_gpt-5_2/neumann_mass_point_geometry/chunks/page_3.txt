**Chunking image sections**

I need to split the image of a handwritten German letter into rectangular chunks that contain lines. There's a top section with some math equations and a bottom section labeled PS with variables. My goal is to ensure there are 3-4 lines of math expressions in each chunk. The page has hole punches on the left side, so I want to include the full width of the page while identifying the resolution as 1051x768.
**Defining image chunks**

I need to determine the exact pixel dimensions based on the resolution tag, which indicates 1051 for height and 768 for width. I'll confirm the width as 768 px and height as 1051 px. To organize the content, I’ll define three chunks: 

Chunk 1 will cover the header and first 8-10 lines, estimated between y=40 and y=330. Chunk 2 will represent the middle paragraph from "Ich habe noch..." to around y=720, setting y1=330 and y2=720. Chunk 3 will include the signature and PS, starting below y=760 to the bottom.
**Refining chunk definitions**

I’m looking at how to best define the chunks for the handwritten letter. For Chunk 3, I’ll adjust the signature section to be from y=650 to y=780, while making Chunk 4 for the PS from y=780 to y=1020. I want to minimize chunk numbers, but I must ensure I don’t have too many equations in each one. Since the middle chunk has no math, I’ll set its end at y=670 to avoid overlap with Chunk 3, which will finalize at y=780. 

Here’s the breakdown:
- Chunk 1: y=55 to y=335
- Chunk 2: y=335 to y=670
- Chunk 3: y=670 to y=780
- Chunk 4: y=780 to y=1015
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

To ensure the PS section is fully included, I’ll make Chunk 3 focus only on the signature, set from y=640 to y=770, just above the "P.S." line. I’ll then move the end of Chunk 4 to capture the text from y=770 to y=1040. It's important to have every line fully contained within at least one chunk. Since the "P.S." line falls around y=780-800, I'll keep it in Chunk 4. The widths will be x1=0 and x2=768, starting from the top margin of 0. 

So, my first chunk will be (0, 0, 768, 340), ensuring there's no text at the very top—this seems like the right approach!
**Defining final chunks and resolution**

I need to finalize my chunk definitions. For Chunk 2, it will be (0, 340, 768, 720). For Chunk 3, I'm adjusting it to (0, 720, 768, 800) because the signature might take up more space! To accommodate the "P.S." line, I’ll make Chunk 4 (0, 770, 768, 1051) and ensure it includes the entire line at 790-810. 

So, my final adjustments would be:
- Chunk 1: (0, 0, 768, 340)
- Chunk 2: (0, 340, 768, 720)
- Chunk 3: (0, 720, 768, 800)
- Chunk 4: (0, 770, 768, 1051)

And the final resolution is (768, 1051).
