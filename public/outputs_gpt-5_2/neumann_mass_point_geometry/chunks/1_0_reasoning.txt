**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe the handwritten German text from the image into HTML format, focusing on a math snippet. I should ignore any partially cut-off lines. The main line seems to be “wird dieser Raum r, θ, φ, t auf den Raum der.” I notice there’s also a mathematical expression involving “x1, x2, x3, x4, x5” and an equation: “x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 - x5^2 = 1.” I'll make sure to format this correctly with MathJax and clear spacing, using italics for the handwritten style.
**Transcribing details from the text**

I think the top text reads "wird dieser Raum r, θ, φ, t auf den Raum des," with "des" likely being correct instead of "der." The variables are clear: "r, θ, φ, t." In the lower left corner, I see "x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 mit". Then an equation appears below this. I’ll create the HTML using MathJax to center the equation and include line breaks, while ignoring any partially cut-off lines, although I don’t see any significant edges.
**Crafting the HTML output**

I'm putting together the lines from the image. The first line will read: "wird dieser Raum r, θ, φ, t auf den Raum des." The second line will be: "x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 mit," though I’ll format the variables as inline math: x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5. Then the centered equation will be: "x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 - x_5^2 = 1." I’ll also include some spacing and use a wrapper div with a cursive or serif font to mimic handwriting, and I’ll ensure to output only the HTML code.
