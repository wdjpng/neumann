**Crafting a signature div**

I'm thinking about creating a div that features a large cursive font, like "Brush Script MT" or "Lucida Handwriting," and I'll make it italic. Including a trailing period at the end might add a nice touch. I want it to be centered and spaced thoughtfully to mimic a baseline. So, it looks like Iâ€™ll just produce a simple signature line. Let's get that done!
