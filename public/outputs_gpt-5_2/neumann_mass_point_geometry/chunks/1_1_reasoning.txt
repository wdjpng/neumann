**Transcribing handwritten German text**

I need to transcribe some handwritten German text that includes math. The image contains a part with the text: "(das De Sittersche Hyperboloid) abgebildet, d.h. auf einem Teil mit x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 < 1. und das Streckenelement wird". I aim to be accurate by reading closely. It seems I should ignore any partially cut-off lines, focusing on the three visible lines provided. I’ll also consider how to format the output, potentially using HTML and MathJax for the math, since aesthetics matter here!
**Formatting German text with math**

I’m considering whether to italicize the German text; seems like it’s not necessary. I definitely need to include the math expression: \( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 < 1 \) using MathJax inline. I also want to clarify if "De Sitter" is spelled correctly since it should be "de Sittersche Hyperboloid" in German. I’ll stick with "De Sittersche" for consistency. 

Next, I’ll create minimal HTML with a serif font and proper line spacing. I’ll use <div> for line breaks and <span> to handle spacing properly. Let's finalize that now!
