**Drafting signaling transcriptions**

I realize that signals between worldlines with opposite time directions can't exist. It makes sense to draft a transcription, marking uncertain parts with square brackets. I want to deliver a faithful transcription while doing my best. 

The lines include important concepts, and I’ll format them properly with HTML and MathJax for clarity, using TeX for symbols. I'll also consider wrapping the text in an elegant, styled format using CSS to enhance readability. Let's make it minimal and appealing!
**Crafting HTML layout**

I need to make sure we ignore any partially cut-off lines at the top. It looks like the starting line, "erklären:", is fully visible, so that's good. Now, I think it’s time to craft the HTML layout properly. I'll focus on ensuring everything is formatted nicely and is easy to read. I'm considering how the final presentation should look to keep it elegant and functional. Let’s get to it!
