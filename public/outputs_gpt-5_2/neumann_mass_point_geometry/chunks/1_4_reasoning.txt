**Transcribing handwritten math**

I need to transcribe text from the image into HTML while preserving its formatting and line breaks. This text is in German and involves math. I should ignore any lines that are partially cut off. I see that the top line might be fully present, but the left edge may be truncated. 

Upon reading the first line, it seems to say something about values for x being greater than r0/r1. I need to focus and ensure I capture it accurately.
**Deciphering the math text**

I'm working through the transcription of the handwritten math text. The first line suggests that for certain values of x, the functions f and h are positive and finite, which seems clear. The next line might start with "Darstellung," and then I see a formula for g(x): "g(x) = 1/x^2 x φ(x)(x−φ(1)) / (x−1)." 

I need to carefully verify parts of this formula, as it includes variables like φ(x) and possibly Q(x). There are fractional terms, and it gets complicated with different variables like r0 and r1. I'll need to ensure I capture everything accurately!
**Continuing the transcription process**

I see the last term looks like “− r_g^2,” but it might be a German letter “r_i^2.” I need to be careful with details while transcribing. The initial text we're working with mentions conditions about x being greater than r0/r1, indicating that f and h are positive and finite. 

There’s a hyphen in the line break that shows “Dar-” transitions into “stellung” in the second line. The formula for g(x) looks complex, so I’ll examine it closely to ensure accuracy.
**Analyzing the formula details**

I’m looking closely at the formula for g(x): "g(x) = (1/x^2) * x φ(x)(x−φ(1))/(x−1), φ(1) = ...”. I wonder if φ(1) means phi evaluated at 1. The text seems to connect φ(1) with Q(x)/(x+1)^2 minus some other terms.

I suspect φ(1) could be a constant, but maybe it’s actually φ’(x), the derivative? That would make sense in terms of Q(x). The notation is tricky though; I see some confusion around the symbols. I’ll need to clarify as I go.
**Reconstructing the math transcription**

I need to carefully interpret the handwritten formula. After the comma, I see “φ(1) =” which could mean either φ evaluated at 1 or φ prime. The left side shows a fraction involving Q(x).

I suspect it was meant to be “g(x) = (1/x^2) * (x φ(x) - φ(1)) / (x - 1).” Then I have some terms related to φ’ and Q(x), and I should clarify those connections. It's tricky since some letters could be misread.

Meanwhile, I’m focusing on this German text about conditions for x and functions f and h. I'll check all the initial details to ensure accuracy while transcribing!
**Crafting HTML for transcription**

I need to create HTML that accurately reflects the handwriting style and transcription of the text. It looks like the German phrase starts with “Daß sich für x > r_0/r_1...” which is clear. I also need to include the math expressions carefully, ensuring they’re formatted correctly using MathJax.

Then I’ll structure the document to keep the line breaks intact and apply some styling that mimics handwriting, like using a serif font for authenticity. I’ll wrap the text and equations nicely, presenting them in an organized way.

Here's the HTML:
