**Transcribing mathematical notation**

I'm looking at the image again and noticing an extra fraction involving Q(x) at the center, aligned with the g(x) line, possibly equal to v1^2/x^2 or r1^2/x^2. There's some text on the right, indicating that Q(x) equals (x - r_0/r_1) followed by other lines that seem messy and possibly repeating. I should focus on the definitions that are fully visible, ignoring any partially cut-off text while being as faithful to the notation as possible.
**Examining mathematical notation**

Let’s take a closer look at the right brace body, which has three lines. The top line shows "Q(x) = (x - r_0/r_1)" but there might also be a multiplication factor since there's a little superscript m. The second line appears to repeat this, and the first line might be incomplete because of a page fold. I’m wondering if "Q(x) = (x - r_0/r_1)(x - r_0/r_1)" could indicate squaring the factor, or if different symbols like γ are involved. The notation does resemble Greek gamma after all!
**Reviewing mathematical lines**

In the second line, it says ". (x - r_0/r_1) =" which might mean they replaced gamma with r. Then the third line is "= x^2 + x - 2m/r_1^3," probably from an expansion. I should be careful about mis-characters, but I need to transcribe exactly as I see it. The left side mentions g(x) which equals 1/(Q(1) x (1-x)), though it seems like it should be Q(x). I need to clarify what to include since the directive mentions fully transcribing all visible text.
**Creating an HTML format**

I’m planning to deliver an HTML document with a stylized header that mimics "wobei f, g, h folgendermaßen definiert sind:" and arrange the equations nicely using MathJax. I could structure it with centered lines or use an italic script style. 

To keep things simple, I’ll style the font to resemble handwriting, maybe in cursive. I’ll use a <div> with the class "equation-block" for alignment, and I’m proposing the following text along with the three equations: 

1. f(x) = r_1^2
2. g(x) = 1 / [Q(x) x (1 - x)] = 4 Q(x) / [Q(1)^2 x (x + 1)^2 (1 - x)]
3. h(x) = (4 Q(x)) / (Q^2(1) x (x+1)) 

It seems like the denominator for h(x) may be missing the (1-x) factor, which is present in g(x).
**Finalizing HTML with MathJax**

I need to review the equations again, especially g(x), which shows a fraction with two equal expressions. The line for h(x) also appears to be a fraction but might be missing some details. I should carefully transcribe everything exactly as I see it, even if it's not mathematically consistent.

I’ll create HTML with a script tag for MathJax to render the math. The header "wobei f, g, h folgendermaßen definiert sind:" will be in italic cursive style. For the layout, I’ll use a CSS grid to align the equations properly. 

I plan to show the left brace using MathJax, omitting any partially cut-off lines, and including all relevant equations as per the instructions. Now, it's time to finalize the HTML code.
