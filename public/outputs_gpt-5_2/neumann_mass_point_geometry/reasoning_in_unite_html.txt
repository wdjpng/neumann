**Combining HTML content**

I need to create a single HTML file that brings everything together while matching the style from the first page scan. That first page features a header with "Hs. 91: 676" in the top-left corner, "Budapest, den 1. III. 1925." in the top-right, and "N.P." in red under the invoice number. I should keep the existing styles and unify the formatting throughout the whole document. The letter pages need to be combined with consistent styling and logical reading order while using MathJax for equations and ensuring nothing is altered.
**Organizing content flow**

I need to start with the header: "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" and include the text that states, "Das Resultat ist das folgende: Darstellen ist der Raum der r, θ, φ, t mit dem Streckenelement." Then, I’ll introduce the equations for ds^2, incorporating both - terms and + time. 

Next, I'll add the condition about the range of m and the roots for r. I want to ensure the transformation mapping to the hyperboloid is clear, including the general form of ds^2 in x coordinates. However, I noticed some issues, like braced expressions that include gamma terms and unknowns. I’ll keep those as they are but ensure parentheses and line breaks are consistent throughout.
**Finalizing the content**

Next, I'll add a note about positivity for x > r0/r1, including the g(x) expression with phi. It’s clear that the hyperbolic space is regular for x > r0/r1, away from the mass point and its antipode.

Then, I’ll address the asymptotic behavior: as x approaches infinity, I need to clarify that f approaches r², even though it was defined earlier as r₁². I'll keep this as is. 

Afterward, there’s a segment discussing the mass point disappearing at infinity and then heading into time dilation in relation to one section, before moving to the closing thanks and signature from "Hans v. Neumann."
**Finalizing signatures and structure**

Another page contains P.S. content identifying antipodes, time direction, and signals. The last lines include "Hochachtungsvoll H.v. Neumann." I noticed there's a potential duplicate signature from the P.S., but it’s traditionally placed after the signature.

Since there’s consistency with the P.S. signing "Hochachtungsvoll H.v. Neumann," I’ll keep both in the final document. I also need to ensure the style matches the first page closely, replicating the header while using page breaks for other sections. I can create multiple `.page` containers, with the header only appearing on the first.
**Creating the HTML structure**

I’ll start by creating an article container that includes letter pages separated by horizontal rules or decorative elements. I'll unify the fonts to Georgia or Times and set a consistent background color using #faf9f7. The letter body will preserve manual line breaks with white space pre-wrap. It’s essential to incorporate MathJax without altering the content, except perhaps for punctuation consistency. 

I’ll embed the header "Hs. 91: 676" alongside the date at the top of the first page and ensure all equations render using MathJax in TeX format. Lastly, I’ll layout the sections logically, ensuring everything flows smoothly, including the signature and Postscript.
**Creating the final HTML structure**

I'll style the apostrophes properly in the text. The content discusses signal directions: it's crucial that each atom's world line has a clearly defined direction, keeping causality in mind.

Signals from A to B can only occur if A is in B's past and vice versa. As such, between world lines with opposite time directions, signals can’t exist, maintaining a hyperbolic structure. I’ll ensure to keep line breaks as they are in the letter style, embed MathJax correctly, and finalize the HTML with consistent classes for layout.
