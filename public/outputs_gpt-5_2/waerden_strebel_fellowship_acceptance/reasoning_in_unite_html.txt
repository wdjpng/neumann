**Unifying letter content**

I’m looking at how to handle the content regarding the duration of his stay in Princeton. There's a grammatical issue in one sentence, and I'm seeing another variant that says he'll write to the authorities. It seems these are just different versions appearing in various snippets. So, my goal is to unify the two while keeping the original meaning intact and making the formatting consistent, without altering the actual content of the letter.
**Evaluating letter structure**

I think the two snippets likely correspond to the same idea. The first snippet is missing a subject, while the second mentions he will write to the authorities about his stay in Princeton. It looks like there are duplicates trying to convey the same content, possibly with revised wording in the second snippet. The instructions specify to remove obvious duplicates without altering content. I’ll need to evaluate whether to choose one or combine both for clarity. Let's look at the overall letter structure.
**Combining letter content**

I’m analyzing how to unify the letter details regarding the duration of his stay in Princeton. One snippet mentions settling with the authorities, while another states he will write to them. There’s also a closing in German and a Dutch phrase that might be scribbles. The instructions indicate keeping the letter content intact while standardizing the format. I want to create a single cohesive letter, maintaining consistent typography, aligning the header to the right, and organizing the address correctly.
**Formatting the letter and envelope**

I need to include the "FLUGPOST" stamp and the address as a separate header for the envelope, while the letter’s own header should remain mostly unchanged. The envelope address isn't part of the letter body but is mentioned in it. I'm considering that the first two HTMLs might come from the reverse or top area. The task is to synthesize a single, consistent format for the letter's main body, keeping the existing header intact and incorporating the envelope address as an "address block" above.
**Deciding on content integration**

I’m considering how to integrate the "FLUGPOST" stamp and address as an "address block" at the top of the letter. The header of the letter itself should remain mostly unchanged. The user wants all content unified but prefers no alterations, just removing duplicates. There are some inconsistencies in how the lines about his stay in Princeton are presented. I could include both lines separated by breaks, but I wonder if that creates unnecessary repetition. It might be best to keep it straightforward and consider how they appear together as one continuous thought.
**Creating the HTML letter**

I'm noting that "voorts wel" and ".A.S.U" might just be margin scribbles, so I can treat them as footnotes or faint text. My plan is to produce a single HTML document with a consistent style, using "Courier New" for the font and a bright background. The user wants all content included without altering any text, just formatting it consistently. 

I’ll keep the "FLUGPOST" stamp and address as an envelope block at the top. It’s important to include both lines about his stay in Princeton without changing their original wording to avoid altering the content. I'll focus on keeping line breaks as they appear and ensuring everything, from the header to the closing, is presented clearly and uniformly.
**Formulating HTML Structure**

I'm working on the HTML letter and considering how to handle the variant lines without altering the content. I'll keep the closing "Herzliche Grüsse / Ihr" in German and include the signature just once. I think it makes sense to place "voorts wel" and ".A.S.U" as faint notes below the signature. 

I'll construct the code with proper structure and style, ensuring everything from the envelope to the body is consistent. I'll check that I preserve line breaks, special characters, and avoid duplicating any lines while including all necessary information. The idea is to maintain clarity and follow the user's instructions closely.
**Creating Final HTML Code**

I'm focusing on the final structure of the HTML letter. The pre-wrap will help preserve the line breaks, so I'll ensure they match the original document precisely. I'll keep elements like "Institute of Advanced Study" and "PRINCETON" in the address without centering.

For formatting, I plan to use "Courier New" as the font and set up CSS classes for margin and background colors. I've decided against using external scripts and will keep all text intact, including maintaining the special character "ü" in "Grüsse." Now, it's time to wrap it all in code!
