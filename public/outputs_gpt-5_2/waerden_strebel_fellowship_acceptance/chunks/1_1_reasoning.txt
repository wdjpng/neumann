We need to transcribe all visible text from the image chunk to HTML, keeping the formatting as close to the original as possible, including line breaks. However, we'll ignore any partially cut-off lines. I need to be cautious, as the image shows only the bottom right part of a typed letter. There’s "Herzliche Grüsse" and "Ihr," but faint inverted text due to bleed-through may not be necessary to include since the instruction says to ignore certain elements.
The reversed text might not be suitable for transcription since it’s faint and likely bleed-through. However, the user did request to “fully transcribe all text in the image,” which implies including all legible content. Still, the focus should be on the main typed lines. The earlier line about writing to the authorities is clear, and there is possibly a preceding line regarding the duration of his stay in Princeton, which may be fully visible. I'll need to verify its clarity before including it.
Let's carefully analyze the text. The topmost line seems to say "concerning the duration of his stay in Princeton," and it looks fully visible even if cut off on the left. The next line is clearly "he will write to the authorities of the Institute." Below that, there's a blank line, followed by "Herzliche Grüsse" and "Ihr," which is centered and likely underlined. The name "(B.L. van der Waerden)" appears at the bottom right and is partly cut off. Finally, I notice some faint mirrored characters spelling "NORTHROP" at the top.
The faint mirrored text at the top appears to say "NORTHROP," which likely comes from letterhead on the back page. The name "(B.L. van der Waerden)" is visible near the bottom, though the left side might be partially cut off. I need to consider if including the faint mirrored text is appropriate since the instruction says to "fully transcribe all text in the image." However, it also mentions ignoring partially cut-off lines, so I’m leaning toward not including the bleed-through text.
I need to format the letter according to the user's request, starting with the main content from the typed lines we've identified. The closing should be right-justified with "Herzliche Grüsse" and "Ihr" aligned to the right margin. 

I’ll ensure punctuation is correct and include line breaks where necessary. The first line will read: “concerning the duration of his stay in Princeton,” followed by, “he will write to the authorities of the Institute.” After that, I’ll include the closing and the signature. Since there’s mention of "NORTHROP," it’s best to ignore it because it's faint and doesn’t contribute positively to the presentation. 

I'll keep the formatting close to the original in style and ensure it looks polished!
I’m deciding how to align the signature and closing of the letter. Maybe I’ll use a left margin of about 55% to approximate the right area or simply right-align the closing while keeping the signature left-aligned. That might make everything clearer! I’ll use padding to move the signature towards the right.

I’ll keep the HTML minimal and ensure it includes style tags for the CSS. I want to set letter-spacing and line-height to mimic typed lines while maintaining accessibility. Plus, I’ll make sure to correctly represent "Grüsse" with the HTML entity for "ü." Let's get this finalized!
