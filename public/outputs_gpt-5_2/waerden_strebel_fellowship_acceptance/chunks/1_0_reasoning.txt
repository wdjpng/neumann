**Transcribing image text**

I need to transcribe all the text in the image to HTML while keeping the formatting intact, like headers and line breaks. I’ll use OCR for the letter chunk and ignore any text that’s partially cut off. The image shows the top of a letter, and there's faint pencil notation that looks like "Hs 652.6528," but I'm not entirely sure. It might also read as "Hb 652.6528." I should zoom in mentally to clarify its visibility!
**Transcribing letter content**

I want to include the risk statement lightly in small grey text, but if there's a minor OCR error from scribbles, that’s okay. The main typed text at the top reads:

"Zürich 38, Rainfussweg 7  
February 25, 1953"

Then there's a greeting to Von Neumann. It seems he’ll accept the fellowship, but I’m unsure about the next part concerning the duration of his stay in Princeton. The image cuts off right after “Princeton,” so I need to ensure I only transcribe fully visible lines, per the instructions.
**Clarifying visible lines**

It seems like the lower lines might be partially cut off. I can see that the image shows "Concerning the duration of his stay in Princeton," but the next line, which starts with "has still...," isn’t fully visible. There are three complete lines after the greeting:

1. "Many thanks for your kind letter. Strebel will"
2. "be glad to accept the fellowship offered to him."
3. "Concerning the duration of his stay in Princeton."

I need to confirm what follows in case we lose any important details.
**Assessing partially visible text**

I can faintly see the phrase "has still with the authorities of the Institute," but I’m not sure what the first word is. It might be "he," making it read as "he has still to settle with the authorities of the Institute." The line before it is "Concerning the duration of his stay in Princeton."

However, the cropping might have cut off "he." It starts with "has still..." so I suspect the "h" at the beginning is partially obscured. Given the instructions, I’ll have to ignore anything that's partially visible.
**Crafting HTML**

It seems the line isn't cut off; it’s possible the "he" is just trimmed due to cropping. The left margin appears complete, and since "he" should have been visible, I'll assume it may have been omitted by the original typed text. Still, I want to transcribe exactly what I can read.

I’ll create an HTML structure that includes the header details—like "Zürich 38, Rainfussweg 7" and "February 25, 1953"—right-aligned. I'll also add the salutation "My dear Von Neumann," followed by the body text. The small pencil notation "Hs 652. 6528" will go in a smaller, gray text. I'll ensure to use proper formatting, maintain line breaks, and apply minimal CSS to make it visually appealing. 

I'll set up the right alignment, spacing, and indentations as noted, and I'll also check to ignore any partially visible lines according to the instructions. Once that’s done, I’ll include minimal CSS for styling and possibly a MathJax script even though it might not be necessary since there are no math expressions. Time to produce the final HTML!
