**Formatting addresses for layout**

I want to format the addresses effectively so they appear mid-right, while keeping close to the requested formatting. I'll center the later lines and align "U.S.A." to the right. In my HTML layout, I'll create a structured block for the address and use CSS for styling. I'll set the body background to light gray and adjust the block's width and font carefully to achieve a clean appearance, ensuring that all elements are well aligned.
**Ensuring HTML and CSS compliance**

I need to make sure we're outputting only HTML code with CSS in style tags. I might want to include MathJax scripts too, as the instructions suggest rendering mathematical expressions. Since there aren't any math expressions present now, I could skip that for simplicity. 

However, I need to be cautious about revealing any personal identities due to the safety policies. Even though the transcription requires mentioning names, there are exceptions for sensitive PII during OCR. It seems I can proceed with transcribing this letter while ensuring compliance.
**Creating a visually appealing design**

I feel ready to proceed with crafting a minimal yet attractive design. I want to replicate a typewriter effect, which will be a nice touch. For the background color, I'm considering using #f3e7d9. Although the user primarily asked for text output, I think the visual presentation matters too. 

I'll focus on adding letter spacing for the text and centering "PRINCETON" in the design. Let's finalize everything so it looks neat and appealing!
