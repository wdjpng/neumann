**Analyzing street names**

I think "Törökbálinti út" is in the southwestern area. The "Dr. Török" could mean 'Doctor Török road,' but usually, names here are more specific, like "Dr. Csikihegyek út." Near Svábhegy, there's definitely "Eötvös út," which is significant. It's also associated with the famous Eötvös Loránd Geophysical Institute. I notice that "Eötvös" has a specific spelling, and it could be related to the physicist Eötvös. Some names include "Eötvös (József) út."
**Clarifying the street name**

I’ve noticed that the letters "Eötvös" fit the visible loops and diacritics in the image, confirming it’s "Dr. Eötvös út." There are indeed two small dots above the 'o,' which matches perfectly. So, the second line likely reads: "dann: Budapest (Svábhegy) Dr. Eötvös út 45."

That looks plausible! The full content would be:

"(Bő 20. VIII.: Selwyn College, Cambridge, dann: Budapest (Svábhegy) Dr. Eötvös út 45.)"

Looks like "Bő" refers to a town in Hungary, and the date is probably August 20. I’m considering how to style it to be visually appealing while maintaining line breaks and simplicity.
**Designing the HTML layout**

I’m considering how to set up the HTML layout. It seems like the edges might be blank, and any partial text issues could be just from cropping. To create an appealing look, I’ll use a centered narrow paper container with a light grid background. 

Even though I can't embed images or external fonts, using simple CSS for a handwritten effect will work. I’ll likely go with a gray-blue color and use a `<div class="letter">` with a `<pre>` element to keep the line breaks. The text will have brackets for clarity:

( Bő 20. VIII.: Selwyn College, Cambridge, dann: Budapest (Svábhegy) Dr. Eötvös út 45.)
**Finalizing the text presentation**

I notice the opening parenthesis at the beginning, indicating that the three lines should be bracketed together. The closing punctuation is “.)” while the last line shows "45.)". So, yes, we need to keep "45.)" intact. It's crucial to preserve punctuation and diacritics as they are. I’ll use a `<pre>` element to maintain the exact spacing and line breaks, and a `<span>` with color #6b8797 for styling, ensuring the container is 800 px wide. 

I hope the transcription is accurate enough, so I’ll finalize it now.
