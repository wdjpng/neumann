**Transcribing content from an image**

I need to transcribe the text from the image into HTML, ensuring I include line breaks and formatting. I have to ignore any lines that are partially cut off. The image appears to show a handwritten German letter snippet, with a main line likely reading "Die Widerspruchsfreiheits-Arbeit." The next visible line seems to say "schicke ich beiliegend. 3 Litteratur," which might actually be "Literatur." The following text looks like "Angaben, die ich nicht einwandfrei" and "feststellen konnte, habe ich mit einem." Some parts are a bit unclear, but that's the gist!
**Detailing text transcription**

I see that the letters are "feststellen konnt," but it should actually be "konnte" for correct grammar. The handwritten version might have omitted the 'e'. Next, there’s some unclear text following it. After "feststellen konnt," it seems to continue with "habe ich mit einem" or maybe "2 bezeichnet," but the ambiguity leaves me unsure. The bottom part of the screenshot appears partially cut off, so I’ll follow the instruction to ignore that last line and focus only on the fully visible lines.
**Transcribing visible lines**

Let’s take another look to ensure accuracy. The last visible line starts with "werden" and "Herr Prof," but since it’s cut off, I'll ignore it. For the lines that I can transcribe: 

1. "Die Widerspruchsfreiheits-Arbeit" has a hyphen.
2. Next is "schicke ich beiliegend. 3 Litteratur." There’s a dot after "beiliegend." This could be a heading or indicate "3 Litteraturangaben."
3. The following line reads "Angaben, die ich nicht einwandfrei," which combines with the previous line, forming "3 Litteraturangaben, die ich nicht einwandfrei."

I need to keep the original line breaks intact without adding hyphens.
**Clarifying handwritten symbols**

I noticed that the "2" symbol might actually be a question mark "?" that can look similar in handwriting. It seems like the line might read "? bezeichnet," which could fit. Examining further, I see "feststellen konnt, habe ich mit einem." I might correct "konnt" to "konnte," but I need to transcribe exactly as shown. It appears to be "konnt," lacking an 'e.' 

The next line starts with "? bezeichnet, wenn..." but the bottom may be cut off, so I’ll see if it's fully visible.
**Examining text visibility and transcription**

I’m checking the final parts of the image. The line starts with "wenn" and includes "Herr Prof," but the last part might be cut off since it’s at the bottom. I need to follow the instruction to ignore partially cut lines. The line seems mostly visible, so I'll review what I have carefully. It might read "wenn Sie Herr Professor..." and I should keep an eye on details like capitalization.

I’ll finalize the lines to transcribe:

1. "Die Widerspruchsfreiheits-Arbeit"
2. "schicke ich beiliegend. 3 Litteratur"
3. "Angaben, die ich nicht einwandfrei"
4. "feststellen konnt, habe ich mit einem"
5. "? bezeichnet, wenn Sie Herr Prof..."

I think this captures everything I can confirm.
**Preparing HTML for transcription**

I’m getting ready to transcribe the text into HTML. I need to ensure that I'm including everything that's visible without adding extra elements. The instructions say to keep it simple and include MathJax even though there aren't any math expressions here.

Here's what I plan to transcribe:

1. "Die Widerspruchsfreiheits-Arbeit"
2. "schicke ich beiliegend. 3 Litteratur"
3. "Angaben, die ich nicht einwandfrei"
4. "feststellen konnt, habe ich mit einem"
5. "? bezeichnet, wenn Sie Herr Pro..."

I'll format this inside a styled `<pre>` tag to keep the line breaks and use a handwritten font. I'll include a basic CSS for a light paper background without heavy formatting. Now, I’ll write the HTML structure!
