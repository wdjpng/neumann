**Deciding on format and scripts**

I'm planning to create a design like a letterhead with left-aligned shelfmark and right-aligned date and place. I want to use a simple container, possibly a horizontal rule, while ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The visible text will be full words despite cropping. 

Now, regarding the MathJax script, it mentions using it for mathematical expressions, but since there are none, I’m thinking it might be unnecessary to include it. So, I could choose to omit it to keep things simple.
**Creating HTML structure**

I'm working on the HTML code now. I’ll set the body background to white for a clean look, despite the reviewer suggesting a normal plain background. For the header, I want to use a pencil-like grey font to mimic that pencil effect. 

Next, I’ll apply flexbox to align the left and right text on the same line, perhaps using a cursive font to echo handwriting without over-styling. So, I’ll choose a handwritten-style font like "Segoe Script" in grey.

I’ll also make sure to include padding in the letter-chunk container and represent the text as ". Hs 91: 677" using a monospace font.
**Finalizing HTML structure**

I'm wrapping up the HTML code. It seems I should use a bullet dot '·' instead of a plain dot since the user’s screenshot shows it clearly. I want to make sure it looks nice, so I’ll choose that middle dot.

Next, I need to address the spacing because there’s some cropping in the vertical alignment. I’ll use flexbox with space-between to spread the elements out. I'll also consider adding "font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums" as an option.

To finalize, I’ll keep it minimal with line breaks in a single line and include the necessary `<meta charset>` for correct encoding.
