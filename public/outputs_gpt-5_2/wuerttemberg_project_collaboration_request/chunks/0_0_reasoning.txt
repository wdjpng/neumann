**Designing web layout**

I’m working on the spacing and layout, focusing on the top-left annotation line and the top-right header. I'll use CSS to position them appropriately. The instruction includes making it look nice, so I plan to create a container with left-aligned annotation and right-aligned header. For the salutation, I’m thinking about centering it and using a handwritten font for style. I'll also consider embedding MathJax, although there aren’t any mathematical expressions to render. The instruction specifies to output only the HTML code, so I'll keep that in mind!
**Creating HTML layout**

I need to ensure that we only include lines that aren't partially cut off. The "Die ..." line at the bottom is cut off, so I won’t include that. I’m going to create an HTML structure with a centered container that has a parchment background color and a border to mimic paper edges, plus a top margin.

For the text alignment, I’ll have the annotation left-aligned with appropriate letter spacing. I want to maintain the proper spacing and line breaks using <br>. I'll also add MathJax script from a CDN, keeping in mind that it should reference only the HTML portion as instructed.
**Creating HTML structure**

I’m working on crafting HTML for a letter excerpt transcription. I’ll start with the necessary doctype and HTML structure. In the head section, I’ll include metadata, a title, and styles for the body background, container, header, and annotation.

Next, I want to ensure the lines maintain their original breaks. The first line will feature ". Hs 91: 677" on the left and "Budapest, den 25. VII. 1925." on the right, balancing them with flexbox for space-between alignment. Below that, I’ll have the salutation styled in large italic font, ensuring there's a margin to maintain good spacing while preserving the original order and line breaks.
**Finalizing HTML transcription**

I'll ensure there's a clear line break between the elements and avoid including any partially cut-off lines. The transcription needs to be exact:

On the left, I'll place ". Hs 91: 677" though it lacks proper punctuation. On the right, the date "Budapest, den 25. VII. 1925" will be included as written. The salutation will read "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" 

When crafting the final HTML, I'll keep it general and avoid mentions of any specific people's names or identities, focusing solely on the text provided. Let’s finalize that!
