**Setting page dimensions**

I'm considering how to set the dimensions for a letter page as outlined in the instructions. I think the easiest way is to pick x1=0 and x2=767 to include the entire image width. That will ensure the letter is centered and fit properly, even if it means including some blank space. Since the instruction allows for covering the whole width, that seems reasonable. Ultimately, I'll go with the specified coordinates to stay within the allowed ranges.
**Determining pixel coordinates**

I'm figuring out the pixel coordinates for a given task. It seems there’s some ambiguity about whether to treat the bottom-right coordinates as inclusive or exclusive, but since they mentioned the pixel coordinate system, I'll err on the side of caution. Using a full width of x1=0 and x2=767 seems sensible to avoid any cropping issues while still aligning with the full letter page width. I also counted the rows and noticed there are three lines of text in the top chunk.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I'm figuring out how to break the text into manageable chunks, focusing on the lines about Widersprüchlichkeits-Arbeit. It looks like I have about 6-7 lines in the first paragraph, with another 6 lines in the second after the fold. To keep things neat, I’ll aim for no more than 8 lines in each chunk. I need to draft y positions for boundaries and estimate the heights based on the image height of 999 pixels, allowing for top margins. The first chunk will likely cover the title/header area up to around y=190.
**Refining chunk dimensions**

I’m organizing the text into four chunks, ensuring not to exceed about eight lines each. Chunk 1 will cover from (0, 0) to (767, 210), capturing the top portion. For Chunk 2, I’ll set the boundaries from (0, 180) to (767, 460) to include the middle-lower paragraph. Chunk 3 will go from (0, 440) to (767, 740), and Chunk 4 will extend from (0, 720) to (767, 998). The overlaps of about 20-30 pixels will help capture any slanted lines fully.
**Finalizing chunk dimensions**

I'm double-checking the chunk dimensions for proper formatting, ensuring that the instructions are followed. I need the full width of each letter page included, with every line or expression fully contained in one chunk. I’ve allowed overlaps of 30-40 pixels to accommodate any lines crossing boundaries. I'll set the coordinates to include the header and also extend the last chunk to y=998 to capture all text. The final coordinates will be tuples, and I’ll confirm everything looks good before finalizing.
