**Dividing the handwritten image**

I need to split the image of a handwritten letter in German into chunks based on coordinates and bounding rectangles. The goal is to create chunks of around eight lines each, ideally using 3-5 chunks per page. The prompt emphasizes including the full width of the letter while leaving small margins at the edges. The image resolution mentioned is 999x768, which seems correct, but I notice I need to confirm the orientation since it appears taller than wide.
**Clarifying image resolution**

I’m rethinking the code "resolution 999 768." It might actually mean "height 999, width 768." Typically, the first value is width, as seen in "resolution 1024 768," where 1024 is width. The page does appear taller than wide, which makes "height 999, width 768" seem plausible. The textual overlay suggests ambiguity, yet cropping references 999 as the height. In thumbnails, the dimensions indicate that 999 is indeed the height. So, the final size should be 768w × 999h.
**Parsing the letter layout**

I'm looking at a single-page letter that has small text at the top saying "HS 91: 677" on the left and "Budapest, den 25.VII.1925." on the right. The body starts with "Sehr..." and contains about 15 lines. I want to split it into 4-5 vertical chunks without slicing any lines. I'll propose using 4 chunks: one for the header and greeting, then for each of the paragraphs. Each chunk should include the full width of the letter page, starting with x1 set to around 70 for margins.
**Defining letter page boundaries**

I think the width of the letter page refers to the section within the image, rather than the entire image itself. The guidelines indicate that coordinates should be in pixels from the original image, and we need to ensure that all lines in each chunk are included. To cover the full width of the page, I can set x1 to 0 and x2 to 768, which allows for a bit of overlap. 

For chunking, I'll create: 
Chunk 1 for the top region, which includes small marginal text like "HS 91: 677" and the date. This will cover y from 0 to approximately 210. Then for Chunk 2, I'll focus on the first few lines of the paragraph.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I'll define the chunks for the letter, ensuring each one contains complete lines and reasonable overlaps to avoid splitting any lines. For Chunk 1, I'll set the coordinates from y=0 to 220. Chunk 2 will go from y=200 to 480. Chunk 3 will cover lines from y=460 to 720, and Chunk 4 will run from y=700 to 999. I'll confirm the resolution as 768 for width and 999 for height, producing the final output with the defined tuples for each chunk, ensuring no more than 2 to 4 lines of any mathematical expression are present.
