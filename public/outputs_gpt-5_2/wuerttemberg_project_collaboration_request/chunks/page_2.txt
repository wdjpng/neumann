**Evaluating image segmentation**

I need to split the image into rectangular chunks for OCR segmentation, but I noticed it’s a handwritten letter with faint text lines instead of math, which is irrelevant since instructions say to focus on mathematical expressions.

For text, I’ll keep about eight lines per chunk, capturing the whole width of the letter pages too. I’ll use the coordinates (top-left and bottom-right) for each chunk. The resolution is 768x996, confirmed from the alt text. I'll make sure to verify this is accurate!
**Defining image chunks**

I need to output the resolution as (768, 996). For chunking the single page, I’m spotting faint cursive lines near the top-middle and a line with parentheses toward the mid-lower part. 

I’ll carefully assess the layout: the top margin is blank, while around y160, there’s a line that says "danke, verbleibe ich hochachtungsvoll." Further down, at y=260 is "Ihr ganz ergebener," and at y=340, there's "Hans v. Neumann." There’s also a parenthetical line near y=480. I suspect there are two lines stacked around y=540.
**Creating chunks for text**

It looks like there are about five lines of handwritten text in total, so I’ll create two chunks to ensure proper coverage.

For Chunk 1, I’ll cover the top half, including the first three lines, extending from y1 around 80 to y2 at 400. I can include the full width across the page, setting x1 at 0 and x2 at 768, despite the gray border background. “Whole width” suggests including the page only, but it’s fine to cover the entire image here.

Chunk 2 will focus on the lower block of lines, covering the area around y=480 to y=620.
**Defining chunk coordinates**

I need to make sure to include both lines in the second chunk, so I’m planning for coordinates where y1 is about 430 and y2 is 640, using the full width. I’ll ensure all lines are fully contained, making a slight overlap between chunks around y=390-450 to maintain coverage. 

To create this overlap, I can set chunk 1’s y2 to 420 and chunk 2’s y1 to 380, allowing for a 40 px overlap. There’s also a faint watermark near the bottom center at y910, which I’ll consider, but only two chunks are needed. 

So, the coordinates for Chunk 1 will be (0, 110, 768, 420). Starting at y=110 seems appropriate since there may not be any header text at y<100.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I need to ensure the first line at y160 is fully contained, so for Chunk 1, I propose coordinates of (0, 90, 768, 440). For Chunk 2, I'd set it at (0, 380, 768, 680) to allow a small overlap between the two chunks. 

It’s important that every line of text is fully contained within one chunk, avoiding any overlap that might cut off lines. The resolution will be listed as (768, 996). I'll show these in the correct output format to meet the requirements.
