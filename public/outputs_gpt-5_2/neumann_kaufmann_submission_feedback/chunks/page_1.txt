**Chunking handwritten letter**

I’m working on chunking this handwritten German letter into sections based on the lines. It seems there are not many mathematical expressions, with "2 1/2" being the only mention. I’ll include the whole width of the page when it makes sense. There are around 14-16 lines, so I’ll create chunks that cover about eight lines each. The header includes "Hs 91: 687" and "N.G.", followed by "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" and more text. This will guide my formatting.
**Chunking more of the letter**

I’m looking at the next lines from the handwritten German letter. I notice phrases like "die Kaufmannsche Arbeit..." and "Ich hoffe... gehandelt," making up about four lines. Then, there's another paragraph starting with "Ich habe mich redlich..." and more lines following that. It seems like I can estimate around 8-9 lines total, given the cropped image. So, it looks like I can organize this into three main chunks: the header, the first paragraph with about 4-5 lines, and the second paragraph with around 4 lines.
**Measuring image coordinates**

I need to ensure each chunk captures the whole width of the handwritten page, which means setting x1 close to 0 and x2 around 768, accounting for the grey margins on the sides. The image resolution is 768x774, and I need to remember that the initial call was cropping. To ensure that every line is fully contained, I'll carefully measure the coordinates while considering that the lines are slightly slanted. I might have to overlap a bit to include everything fully!
**Defining the chunks**

I’m defining the first chunk to capture the header area, which includes "Hs91: 687" and "N.G." I’m estimating the vertical range from about 0 to 150, since "Sehr geehrter..." starts around y 160. I want to set chunk 1’s y2 just above that to avoid including that line. It’s acceptable to include some extra lines across chunk boundaries, but I should minimize overlaps while ensuring lines are fully contained. 

So, I’ll set:

- **Chunk 1:** y 0 to 160 for the header and margin. 
- **Chunk 2:** includes the salutation and first paragraph up to "jetzt geschehen ist," which will be about 5-6 lines.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I’m setting the y-range for chunking from about 150 to 420 and identifying borders for the next chunks. For **Chunk 3**, I’ll capture from around y 420 to the bottom at 774, ensuring it includes lines like "Ich habe mich ..." and "und das Continuum-Problem ... löst!". 

Now, for the x-coordinates, I can set x1 to 0 and x2 to 767 to include the full image width, which is safer. I’ll ensure overlaps are minimal—about 20 pixels vertical. 

Here are the finalized coordinates: 

- Chunk 1: (0, 0, 767, 150)
- Chunk 2: (0, 140, 767, 430)
- Chunk 3: (0, 420, 767, 773)

The resolution will be (768, 774).
