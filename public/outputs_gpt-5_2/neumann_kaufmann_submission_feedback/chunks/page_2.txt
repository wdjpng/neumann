**Verifying image dimensions**

The file mentions a resolution of 774x768, but I see width at 768 and height at 774. The alt text suggests different dimensions, possibly inverted. Markdown shows "resolution 774 768," so let's clarify that typically width is listed first, which means the baseline should be 768x774. I’ll confirm the dimensions and create rectangles across the page width accordingly. The final output will be (768, 774).
**Considering page margins and chunking**

The page region has margins, and I need to include the entire width of the letter page in each chunk if it's reasonable. The image nearly fills the page, so I might set the x1 position around 30 or 40 to ensure full coverage. However, since the instruction asks for the complete width, I’ll set x1 to 0 and x2 to 767. I’ll also ensure that every line of text is fully contained, allowing for some overlap to cover slanted lines. The upper half has about 11 lines, starting roughly from y=140 to 420.
**Defining text chunks**

I see there's a gap before the three closing lines around y=480 to 540, which include "Ich verbleibe hochachtungsvoll," "Ihr ganz ergebener," and the signature "H. v. Neumann." Overall, there are about 14 lines. I plan to create three chunks: 

- Chunk 1 will cover lines 1-7, from y=100 to around y=310.
- Chunk 2 will include lines 8-12, from y=280 to 460.
- Chunk 3 will focus on the closing lines from y=460 to 620.

I’ll ensure each chunk has fewer than eight lines and the full image width while allowing some overlapping to avoid splitting lines. I'll refine the exact y-values based on what I see in the image.
**Estimating line counts for chunks**

Counting lines precisely is tricky, so I'll estimate based on the given text. The first line appears around y=130, and subsequent lines follow at about y=160, 190, 220, and so on, up to y=430, suggesting about 11 lines total. The sample text indicates paragraphs are separated by blank lines. For chunks, I think I can set chunk 1 from y=90 to 305, capturing 6-7 lines, chunk 2 from y=285 to 470, including 5 lines, and chunk 3 from y=455 to 650. I’ll ensure all lines are fully included and set the x-values to 0 and 767.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

The closing lines and some bottom space are considered, with a stamp at the bottom-right around y=690. The image height extends to around 744. The instruction is clear: I need to include the entire width of the letter page while ensuring each line of text is fully contained within chunks. I'm opting for three chunks with overlaps to prevent splitting lines. The coordinate pairs will be:

Chunk 1: (0, 90, 767, 315)  
Chunk 2: (0, 300, 767, 485)  
Chunk 3: (0, 470, 767, 660)  

The final resolution line will be (768, 774).
