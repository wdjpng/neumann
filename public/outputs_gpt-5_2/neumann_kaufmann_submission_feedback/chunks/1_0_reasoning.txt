**Transcribing German text**

I need to fully transcribe the text in the image while making sure to include the unique elements, like the signature scribble. It's important to maintain line breaks, especially for phrases like "Ich verbleibe hochachtungsvoll" followed by "Ihr ganz ergebener," and I should show hyphenation like "Angelegen-" and "heit" correctly. I’m considering using a styled HTML page to present this nicely, perhaps with a decorative narrow container and cursive font to give it a vintage look.
**Crafting HTML for MathJax**

I need to include the MathJax script since the requirement specifies using it for rendering mathematical expressions, even if there aren't any right now. I'll create a minimal HTML document with a styled paper texture for the background. Using a `<pre>` tag seems fine to preserve line breaks, and I’ll format the content with a class for handwritten font styles, ensuring proper letter spacing and line height. Additionally, I’ll make sure to align the text correctly and handle hyphenation as specified. No extraneous text is needed, just the HTML code itself!
**Writing HTML structure**

I’m putting together the HTML structure, starting with the `<html>` tag and including a `<head>` section that has the meta charset and the title "Briefauszug" along with the MathJax CDN script. For the body, I'll create a container styled as 'paper' and place the letter content inside a 'letter' div. I'm thinking of using `<pre>` to keep the line breaks intact while styling it with CSS for a polished look. I'll make sure to include the blank line after "September..." to maintain the formatting!
**Adding fonts and styles**

I'm planning to link to Google Fonts, like "Homemade Apple" or "Dancing Script," for that handwritten look. Using CSS, I’ll incorporate 'Dancing Script' while ensuring we have a solid fallback too. I can add a background with a subtle pattern using a CSS linear gradient. Oh, and I need to remember not to include heavy code or any extra content, like disclaimers. Let’s focus on crafting the final HTML code!
