**Considering header formatting**

I need to keep the formatting for the header as close to the original as possible. It looks like "Hs91; 687" might be a call number, and "N.G." could be initials. I'll create an HTML header with a stylized approach, maybe using a centered container with an old paper font look. 

The important parts will be positioned: the small grey "Hs91; 687" on the top left, followed by "N.G." in larger italic font, and then the salutation "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" below that in cursive style.
**Transcribing text accurately**

I need to transcribe the text exactly as it appears. For Line 1, I'm seeing "Hs91; 687," and I'm not sure whether it should be with or without a space, or maybe it's actually a colon. It looks like "Hs91; 687" might be the safest choice. For Line 2, I see "N. G." and will ensure the proper spacing is included. Line 3 is "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" which I will use as is. Lastly, I should include a MathJax script in the HTML, even though it's not necessary, just to meet the requirements.
**Creating HTML with MathJax**

They mentioned using MathJax to render mathematical expressions, but I'm not sure if I need to include the script if there aren't any expressions. I think it's safer to include a typical script with a CDN, just in case. However, I want to keep the HTML as minimal as possible.

I’ll ensure that lines of text not fully visible in the screenshot are ignored. For the structure, I’ll use a <div class="page"> for layout, keeping fonts simple but adding stylistic cursive to mimic handwriting while avoiding heavy formatting.
**Crafting the HTML letter**

I'm creating an HTML document for the letter, ensuring it looks nice with a beige background. I have the styling set up: a letter container with appropriate fonts. I also want to make sure there are no issues with line breaks; while I’ve used separate `<div>` elements, I might need to use `<br>` tags just in case.

I noticed the initials could be "N.G." without a space, so I’ll keep that in mind for accuracy. Since this is just a letter and contains no faces, I think we're good to go!
**Finalizing initials formatting**

The image shows "N.G." with dots after both letters, and the spacing between them isn't large. I'll write it as "N. G." to mirror that style since the black heavy calligraphy looks nice. Since it’s important to maintain that visual accuracy, I’ll accept this form. Alright, I'm ready to finalize this detail and move on, ensuring it aligns with what the user expects!
