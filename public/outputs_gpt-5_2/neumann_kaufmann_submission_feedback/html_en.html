      <div class="salutation">Dear Professor!</div>

      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>I have just received your letter, and have sent off Kaufmann's work together with my comments to Mr. Kaufmann. I hope to have acted in accordance with your intentions, and please excuse that this has only now been done.</p>

        <p>I have made an honest effort to formulate my objections as little brutally as possible; it was not easy, given that Mr. Kaufmann <u>forgets</u> trifles like the principle of complete induction, and solves the continuum problem in 2Â½ pages!</p>

        <p>I would not let this opportunity pass without expressing to you, Professor, my sincere gratitude for the great kindness you have shown me throughout the matter of the prize competition. Since I wish to trouble you, Professor, as little as possible with the proofs, I will perhaps collect them in Zurich at the end of September.</p>

        <div class="closing">
          <p>I remain respectfully</p>
          <p>Yours most devotedly</p>
        </div>
