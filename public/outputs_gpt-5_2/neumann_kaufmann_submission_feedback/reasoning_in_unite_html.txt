**Synthesizing HTML document**

I need to create a single HTML file that combines multiple inputs with consistent formatting. I'll keep the header mostly intact but won’t alter the content of the letter. My goal is to remove duplicates and unify the formatting, specifically for the letter’s body while leaving the header unchanged. I’ll make sure to accurately reconstruct the letter using the given content from the files, including the required metadata, initials, salutation, and signature.
**Refining the letter content**

I'm working on ensuring that the letter maintains its intent while avoiding any duplicate salutations. The first salutation appears in the header, so I need to remove the repeated one from the second piece to keep things clean. The instruction is clear: leave the header as it is and don't alter the letter's content, though removing duplicates is permissible. I’ll make sure to include the body from the third piece, keeping everything coherent.
**Standardizing formatting**

I see that the letter uses an underlining style, especially with the text "vergisst." I want to keep that emphasis while unifying the formatting, so I should preserve the underlining as it might add significance. Since the second piece uses "pre" for line breaks and the third adopts a stylized "paper" look, my goal is to create a consistent format across the letter. I’ll set up a CSS style with a single "paper sheet" container and a standard font, while leaving the header's pencil style as is.
**Preserving text features**

I want to ensure that I preserve any important formatting like the underlined "vergisst" using the <u> tag. I’ll keep the German spelling conventions as they are, including "daß." The third piece has line breaks with hyphenations, which raises the question of whether to alter those. Although changing hyphenation could be seen as altering the text, I think it's best to keep them consistent as they are in the transcription, even if it feels a bit unusual when unifying the format.
**Combining text elements**

I need to maintain a handwritten style with line breaks and preserve existing content, including hyphenation. The text fragments should be joined correctly, particularly when a word is split by a line break. For example, "las-" and "sen" should merge into "lassen" without altering the spelled content. 

However, I’ll also unify formatting across paragraphs and should probably remove hyphenations caused by line breaks while keeping the original meaning intact. I can construct clearer paragraphs while preserving original words and any necessary formatting, like underlined terms. Let's move forward with these adjustments.
**Formatting the letter**

I'm creating a unified formatting for the letter, ensuring to keep important elements like the signature and header intact. The header will include "Hs91; 687," "N. G.," and the salutation. 

I'll maintain the body structure, combining sections while keeping it readable. For instance, I'll join hyphenated words correctly and retain the underlining for emphasis. I also need to unify fonts while avoiding heavy formatting. Lastly, I'll structure the final HTML with appropriate CSS classes for a clean look. Let’s get to work on this!
**Creating final HTML and CSS**

I'm finalizing the letter's formatting by titling it "Transkription des Briefes." For the CSS, I’ll unify styles, borrowing from the initial design while ensuring readability. The letter’s header will keep elements like the "Hs91; 687" and "N. G." initials in a larger script, followed by the salutation. 

I will maintain the paragraphs with a serif font and underline "vergisst" as specified. The closing lines and signature will be formatted correctly, and I'll check to ensure everything appears seamless and coherent. Let’s get to coding this!
**Finalizing HTML and content verification**

I need to ensure that "white-space: pre-wrap" is not applied since I'll rely on paragraphs for formatting. Now, I'll produce the final HTML code while including the necessary meta charset and language attributes. 

I confirm all content is accurate, including the crucial “2½ seiten,” and I'm checking for consistency across the text. I've reviewed each paragraph and ensured "Herrn Professor" is correctly spelled throughout. Finally, I’m assembling the code to encapsulate everything neatly, making sure I've not missed any details. Time to finalize this!
