  "summary": "Von Neumann thanks Weyl for sending proofs of his group theory booklet and expresses interest in its content and scope. He raises a technical concern about Van der Waerden's observation regarding the assignment of operators to physical quantities, particularly the problem of negative eigenvalues for p²q², and questions whether a general assignment scheme is possible under certain mathematical constraints.",
