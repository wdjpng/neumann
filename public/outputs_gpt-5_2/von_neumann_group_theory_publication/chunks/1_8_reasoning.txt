**Transcribing handwritten German**

I need to transcribe some handwritten German accurately while maintaining formatting. I'm considering using HTML and MathJax for any mathematical content, and I’ll ignore any cut-off lines in the image. The text starts with "* ) Er konstatierte, dass, wenn ...". It seems a bit confusing, but when I zoom in, I see it clearer. The grammar might be tricky with "gehört" appearing twice, so I should inspect the shapes of the letters for clarity.
**Parsing German handwriting**

I see that after "* )" the text reads, "Er konstatierte, dass, wenn die Größe f(p,q) oder Operator T gehört, die φ(f(p,q)) im allgemeinen nicht φ(T) gehört." I'm not completely confident about the interpretations, so I'll analyze the letter shapes closely. The underline at the start might indicate "* )", and there's definitely an underline under "nicht." 

I consider whether the first word could be "Z" instead of "Er." However, it looks like "Er" based on the E-like shape I see, and there’s a distinct long loop in "konstatierte."
**Clarifying German phrases**

Okay, so now I'm matching a few phrases accurately. I confirm that "Größe" and "f(p,q)" are correct. I'm reconsidering "der Operator T gehört," since the grammar seems off. It might be more like, "wenn die Größe f(p,q) zu Operator T gehört." I think using “zu” works better here than “der” or “den.” I often see “zu” pop up. 

After "Größe f(p,q)," there’s likely reference to "zu Operator T gehört," and I want to explore the shapes in the text after "oder" to clarify further.
**Refining the transcription**

Oops, it looks like I misidentified "oder" earlier. I think it may actually be "zu" instead! 

Now, the word between "Größe f(p,q)" and "Operator T" seems to be "der," but I wonder if it could also be "dem" since the loop might suggest "zu." So when I analyze, "wenn die Größe f(p,q) dem Operator T gehört" sounds grammatically correct—like it means "belongs to the operator T." 

I’ll check if the text indicates "dem," as that fits the context much better.
**Creating HTML for transcription**

I’m finalizing the transcription with the line, "die φ(f(p,q)) im allgemeinen nicht φ(T) gehört." I suspect it should read "zu φ(T) gehört." In reviewing the grammar, "nicht zu φ(T) gehört" makes sense, where "zu" might be visually unclear in the image. Thus, the full probable sentence is: 

"*) Er konstatierte, dass, wenn die Größe f(p,q) dem Operator T gehört, die φ(f(p,q)) im allgemeinen nicht zu φ(T) gehört."

Now, I need to create an HTML layout, using MathJax to render any formulas, while also adding styling to give it a handwritten look. I’ll ensure to incorporate all the elements necessary and provide a clean display.
