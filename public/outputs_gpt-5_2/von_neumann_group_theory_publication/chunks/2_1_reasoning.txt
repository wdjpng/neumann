**Transcribing handwritten math**

I need to transcribe the text from an image into HTML format and use MathJax for any math symbols. This snippet seems to be related to German math, containing lines like "T_{f+g} = T_f + T_g." I’m noting the unique symbols, like a stylized "T" or possibly a "Γ." The second line looks like "T φ(f) = φ(I_f)," but I’m finding it tricky to decipher everything clearly. I'll focus on parsing it accurately while ignoring partially cut-off lines.
**Transcribing math symbols**

I'm examining the image for text that needs to be transcribed into HTML, specifically using MathJax for the math parts. The leftmost symbol looks like an integral sign but may also resemble a "T" or "Γ." I can see subscripts like "I_f" and phrases like "φ is a single-variable function." The first line clearly states "T_{f+g} = T_f + T_g." It's crucial to preserve line breaks in the HTML, and since both lines are fully visible, I'll create a minimal styled HTML block for that.
**Creating display equations**

I need to craft two display equation lines. One of them will include the inline German text in parentheses, specifically " (φ eine einvariablen-funktion)." The scribbled notes show "einvariablen-funktion," possibly with a tilde above the "u." I’ll replicate "einvariablen-funktion" as they wrote, including the hyphen. The second line will read: "T_{φ(f)} = φ(I_f) (φ eine einvariablen-funktion)." There's some confusion about whether it's "I_f" or "T_f," so I’ll need to review that second line carefully.
**Deciding on variable notation**

I'm looking closely at the left 'T' and comparing it to what's inside the parentheses. It seems like it might not be a 'T' after all; instead, it looks more like an 'I' with a subscript 'f.' The notation φ(I_f) suggests that 'I' could represent an integral functional, especially since the left side shows "I_{f+g} = I_f + I_g," a property of linear functionals. The scribbles indicate that the shape is indeed 'I.' So, I think I'll use 'I' with the subscript across both lines.
**Crafting the HTML with MathJax**

I've outlined the equations I need to format for HTML:

- The first line is \( I_{f+g} = I_f + I_g \)
- The second line is \( I_{φ(f)} = φ(I_f) \) with the inline remark in German.

To achieve a nice spacing style, I will wrap everything in a simple container with a monospace font, ensuring it looks clean yet appealing. I’ll incorporate the MathJax script properly, using the \(\mathcal{I}\) notation for consistency since it mimics the handwriting style.

Here’s the HTML structure:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
  <style> 
    body { font-family: 'Georgia', serif; background: #f8f6ef; padding: 24px; } 
    .note { ... } 
    .equation-line {...} 
    .inline-remark {...}
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="equation-line">
    $$\mathcal{I}_{f+g} = \mathcal{I}_f + \mathcal{I}_g$$
    $$\mathcal{I}_{\varphi(f)} = \varphi\!\left(\mathcal{I}_f\right) \qquad (\varphi\ \text{eine einvariablen-funktion})$$
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This outputs everything succinctly in a styled container, including the equations and necessary formatting.
