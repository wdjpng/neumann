**Analyzing image resolution**

I’m looking at the image’s resolution, which states "1015 768". Typically, that means width is 1015 and height is 768, but this is a portrait page, so that doesn’t seem right. It might be that the dimensions are reversed. Previous tasks used "1024 768," indicating width as 1024. I'll need to ensure that my bounding boxes fully encompass the text and split the content into 4-5 manageable chunks corresponding to different sections of the page.
**Examining content structure**

I'm reviewing the content layout. The top lines are in dark ink, spanning from about y=80 to y=280. There's another paragraph with some complex math, like \( e^{(i/2 f(e9))} \), which is pretty hard to read. Following that, I see text beginning with "diese Einwand bekannt" around y=300 to 450, along with a horizontal line. Below that are footnotes with equations that clearly contain math. The challenge is determining which lines count as "mathematical expressions," especially since the guidelines suggest limiting these to three to four lines per chunk.
**Organizing math content**

I notice that the handwriting contains both inline math and sections dominated by equations. The bottom block has multiple lines of equations, so I might need to split it into two chunks to keep the math line count manageable. I also have to include the entire width of the page, keeping in mind that there are margins. I'll set the bounding boxes to cover the range from x=80 to x=940 to ensure I'm capturing the full width of the content while staying within the image boundaries.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I’m working on setting up the margins for the page. The left margin seems to start around x=80 and the right at x=920, but to be on the safe side, I'll widen that to x1=50 and x2=980. This keeps everything within the image width of 1015. For the y-dimension, I want to start near the top around y=40 and end around y=730. I'll split the content into five chunks to avoid exceeding the equation limit, covering headers, text blocks, and footnotes.
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I'll make sure to allocate coordinates accurately, beginning with the final footnote, which is a single line of text that runs from y=640 to y=735. Since the instructions require each line to be fully contained, I might need to overlap some chunks slightly. The width is set based on the page dimensions, confirming that the effective size is 768 width and 1015 height. So I'll adjust my x-coordinates to x1=40 and x2=740 to ensure full page coverage, and for y-coordinates, I've set several segments for the content while allowing necessary overlaps to capture slanted lines and ensure accuracy.
**Final adjustments for coordinates**

In chunk four, there are some math lines to consider. The explanatory line "**)" contains several mathematical letters, and additional equations may fill about three lines. I need to ensure that every single line is fully contained within one chunk, so overlapping boundaries by 20-50 pixels should work well. I’ll finalize the coordinate resolutions as (40, 60, 730, 210), (40, 190, 730, 330), (40, 320, 730, 480), (40, 475, 730, 780), and (40, 640, 730, 790), while confirming the resolution is (768, 1015).
