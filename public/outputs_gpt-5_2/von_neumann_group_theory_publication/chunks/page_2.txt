**Breaking down document chunks**

I need to split the handwritten German document, which has some equations, into rectangular chunks. It looks like I can reasonably make 3-4 chunks: a header paragraph, main text lines, a footnote equation zone, and a bottom annotation. I have to ensure that no more than 3-4 lines of mathematical expressions are in each chunk. There are inline math expressions throughout, like "p^2" and "q," but I found a section at the bottom with some formulas. The image resolution is noted as 1015x768, so I need to finalize those pixel coordinates.
**Clarifying image resolution**

I'm trying to untangle the image dimensions. It suggests a width of 1015 and a height of 768, but typically that means a portrait orientation should have the width as 768 and height as 1015. I see the display states "resolution 1015 768," which hints that 1015 is the height and 768 is the width, making sense for a portrait layout where height is greater. However, the final format expects the output as (width, height), which will be (768, 1015). It’s good to double-check!
**Examining page content**

I’m exploring the contents of the page. At the top, there’s a margin and a header starting with "Vor ca ...", followed by several lines of text and some scribbled footnote stars. Then, there’s a horizontal rule, followed by a block of equations and another footnote star line. I need to create rectangular chunks across the full width of the page. I think I can craft four chunks, starting with the top paragraph lines, likely from around y=40 to 350. I'll set x1 to 0 to capture the entire width. Let's fine-tune these y coordinates—maybe y1=20 and y2 just before the footnotes, around y=640-680.
**Estimating segmentation**

I'm estimating the y segmentation for the content. The top two-thirds contain paragraphs of text from around y=40 to 650, followed by a horizontal line and a footnote block from y=670 to 920. There’s a short footnote continuing to nearly y=980. I need to be cautious not to split any lines, and while I can't be perfectly precise, I can overlap a bit to ensure full containment. I’ll keep chunks to around eight lines of text, making two to three chunks for the top paragraphs since there are about fifteen lines. For equations, the most important thing is to keep them to no more than three or four lines per chunk, but there aren’t separate equation lines in that top area.
**Defining chunks and coordinates**

I'm proposing some chunk coordinates for the document. 

- Chunk A covers the top area, with lines 1-6 set from y1=30 to y2=210.

- Chunk B includes lines 7-12, starting at y1=190 (overlap) to y2=390.

- Chunk C captures lines 13-18, from y1=360 to y2=630, just before the horizontal rule.

- Chunk D is for the equations and footnotes, with y1=640 to y2=820.

- Chunk E covers the final footnote area from y1=800 (overlap) to y2=980.

To ensure clarity and avoid confusion on widths and resolutions, I'll finalize the coordinates as (0, 30, 767, 220), (0, 200, 767, 410), (0, 390, 767, 650), (0, 640, 767, 830), and (0, 820, 767, 1000). This keeps within the suggested overlaps and full width. I'll confirm the total dimensions as (768, 1015), ensuring my ranges meet the specified conditions. I think we’re set to go!
