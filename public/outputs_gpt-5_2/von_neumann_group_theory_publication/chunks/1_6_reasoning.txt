**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe the handwritten letter in German into HTML, maintaining similar formatting. The user wants MathJax for the mathematical expressions. I’ll ignore any lines that are cut off. It looks like there's a footnote that starts with "**)" indicating a footnote. It states, "Nämlich ein kontinuierliches Spektrum von - ħ^2/(16π^2) bis + ∞; zum Eigenwert E = - ħ^2/(16π^2) + α^2 gehören die ...". I need to ensure accuracy and examine the image closely, noting the two asterisks and parentheses.
**Examining mathematical symbols**

I'm looking closely at the image. The symbol in the numerator appears to be h-bar squared, represented as "ℏ^2." It looks like "h^2" with a short horizontal dash above the 'h.' The denominator is "16 π^2," which has π squared. I see the phrase "- h^2/(16π^2) bis + ∞" clearly, and there’s another instance of "h^2 over 16π^2" above the line, possibly typed. I need to ignore any partially cut-off lines, but most of the text is fully visible.
**Formatting transcribed text**

In the single-line image, the line looks complete, with "gehören die" fully visible, even if "die" is cut on the right. I need to replicate the formatting while keeping it minimal. A neat blockquote or styled div that mimics the handwritten style could work well. I can add light background color and use CSS for styling. For the font, something like "Times New Roman" or a script style like "Caveat" could give a nice touch, but I’ll have to stick to more standard fonts. MathJax will handle the math formulas properly.
**Including MathJax in HTML**

I noticed they didn't specify including the MathJax CDN script, even though the user asked for MathJax to render mathematical expressions. It seems safe to include the script tag in the HTML. I can wrap the line in a poem style with appropriate line heights. The line text is "**) Nämlich ein kontinuierliches Spektrum von − ℏ²/(16π²) bis +∞; zum Eigenwert E = − ℏ²/(16π²) + α² gehören die." 

I will ensure the minus sign appears correctly as a proper hyphen with "&minus;." I'll format the equations using inline math, and then produce the HTML, starting with the DOCTYPE.
**Crafting complete HTML snippet**

The user wants me to provide a complete HTML snippet, including the head and body, while completely ignoring lines of text that are partially cut off. I'll create a minimal document with styles and MathJax. I should maintain exact line breaks, keeping it as one line while styling the container with margins, font size, line height, and letter spacing to give a handwriting feel.

I’ll also format the footnote markers as superscript, and include the content inside a pre tag to preserve spacing. The final structure will look something like:

```html
<div class="letter">
  <span class="foot">**)</span> Nämlich ein kontinuierliches Spektrum von - h^2 / 16π^2 bis + ∞; zum Eigenwert E = - h^2 / 16π^2 + α^2 gehören die
</div>
```

I’ll ensure the German text is accurate and includes all necessary spaces. Time to finalize it!
