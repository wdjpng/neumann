**Considering HTML output**

I see that the instructions say to use MathJax for math expressions, and "Eigenwerte" is a mathematical concept without equations. I’m realizing I'll need to output only HTML code. For the asterisks, I think using superscript could be a good choice since they appear raised in handwriting. 

I want to ensure I keep the formatting close to the original, so I’ll wrap the text in a <div> with a cursive font-family. I’ll make sure to include only visible text as asked. Let's draft that!
**Crafting minimal HTML**

I notice they didn’t specifically ask to include the MathJax script, just to use it for rendering math expressions. I could omit the script to keep things minimal, but I'm considering if I should include it to enable viewing. Since earlier tasks typically included it, I feel a bit unsure.

For safety, I’ll opt to omit it. I’ll produce a simple HTML structure, using CSS for styling. I’ll ensure we accurately replicate the text with special characters. Let’s finalize the HTML!
**Finalizing HTML document**

I’m ready to create the HTML document with a proper structure. I’ll use the `<div>` class for handwritten text and ensure the specified styling is applied, including the background and font. 

I’ll double-check that everything looks good, including the spacing and punctuation. I need to adhere to the instruction to ignore any partially cut-off lines, which seems fine since we only have the one line. 

So, I’ll deliver this polished HTML now!
