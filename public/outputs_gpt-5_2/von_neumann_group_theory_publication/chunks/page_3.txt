**Determining image chunks**

I'm tasked with outputting bounding boxes for chunks in an image of a handwritten German letter that includes mathematical expressions. It’s important that each chunk captures only 2-4 lines of math and there's a need to select 2-10 rectangular chunks. I should visually inspect the image and make sure to use the full width of the letter page when it makes sense. The resolution is 768x997 pixels, so I'll confirm that orientation before splitting the content into chunks.
**Analyzing math expressions**

I see a paragraph beginning with "Man kann übrigens nach Van der Waerden zeigen, dass..." which contains inline math, specifically f -> Tf. There are various equations in the handwriting that seem to represent mathematical operations, like "Tf" and "operatoren T_f." The equations include "I_{f+g} = I_f + I_g" and "T_{ϕ(f)} = ϕ(I_f)," with a note about ϕ being a single-variable function. Additionally, there's mention of "I_g ≡ {φ}" and a reference to operators. I need to review the image more closely for accuracy!
**Structuring mathematical content**

I’m identifying that there are likely 2-3 lines of mathematical expressions. It's important that no chunk includes more than 2-4 lines, so I can create a separate chunk for the math block containing 2-3 lines. Below that, there are German text paragraphs expressing thanks, along with a signature "J. v. Neumann." Additionally, there's a footnote that starts with "*). Ich glaube, dass man hieraus schließen sollte..." which seems to reference "p und q." I need to select rectangles that may span the full width of the page and allow overlaps to include each line properly.
**Planning the chunks**

I'm aiming to create around 4 chunks. There's a small line "iot" at the top left, which might be a fragment from a previous page. I could include it with the first paragraph, but I need to make sure that any chunk contains no more than 3-4 lines of equations. The initial paragraph starts with "Man kann übrigens..." and might go over 3 lines before the math begins. If I add the math block with its 2-3 lines, that could exceed the limit. So, I have to be careful with how I structure these chunks!
**Planning chunk boundaries**

The overall instruction allows for about eight lines of text in each chunk. I need to manage the sizes carefully. For Chunk 1, I might combine the small "iot." line and the introductory paragraph leading into the equations, but it can't exceed the line limit. The math block should be in Chunk 2, which will include equations and ensure no line splitting occurs.

For the subsequent chunks, I’ll divide the text and limit the total lines, ensuring that the math and text are properly organized. I need to estimate pixel positions to set accurate boundaries for each chunk. Let's make sure to capture the essence while adhering to guidelines!
**Refining chunk coordinates**

I'm setting up the boundaries for the chunks, ensuring no more than eight lines per section and maintaining overlaps. 

Chunk 1 will include the top lines and stop at y=235 to avoid capturing math lines. Chunk 2 captures the math block starting at y=230 to y=460. For Chunk 3, I'll set y1=440 to include the relevant text up to y=670. Chunk 4 includes closing lines from y=650 to y=860, while Chunk 5 captures the footnote from y=860 to y=996. Each chunk will maintain consistent width from x1=0 to x2=767. 

I’ll finalize the coordinates and make sure all math lines fit within their respective chunks, ensuring they aren't split across boundaries.
