**Analyzing image dimensions**

I need to clarify the resolution given as "997 768." I’m interpreting width as 997 and height as 768, and the image is landscape-oriented. The page is letter-sized, but the image proportions reflect a wider format. I should determine the coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) for each chunk, identifying the top-left and bottom-right corners. The margins and noise on the page edges are important too. I’ll ensure the defined coordinates stay inside the image boundaries while including the full width of the letter page.
**Chunking text carefully**

I need to avoid splitting lines of text, especially since some lines may be slanted. Overlapping chunks is acceptable to compensate for that. My focus will be on mathematical expressions and I aim to keep 3-4 lines of equations per chunk. I’ve noticed a small block of equations in the upper-center, so I’ll create a dedicated chunk for those 3-4 lines, along with other chunks for text lines. It seems the "ist." text appears near y  90, which I’ll need to consider as I inspect the content regions.
**Understanding equations and layout**

The math block contains equations like Gamma_{f+g} = T_f + T_g and T_{phi(f)} = phi(T_f), along with a note about "phi" being a linear function. I see a small "ist." at the top, likely a lead-in from the previous page. I recognize the need to treat lines of text and math expressions separately, ensuring I include each line. For segmentation, I’ll estimate y positions and consider the entire width of the letter page, keeping the margins in mind while noting that we lack exact page edge coordinates.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

For safety, I think I can set x1=0 and x2=996 to cover the full image width. However, the goal is to include just the letter page width, although using the entire image width seems reasonable. A more precise option could be setting x1=60 and x2=730 to align with the paper edges, but that might risk overlooking slanted lines. With a maximum of 8 lines of text per chunk, I could create 4-5 chunks, starting with the header area and including the text leading into the math block.
**Structuring chunks and dimensions**

I’m analyzing a section of text that starts with "ist." and contains lines leading into math equations like Gamma and T_phi. Since there’s a limit on mathematical expressions per chunk, I want to isolate the equations from the text. The first chunk will include the text leading up to the equations, while the second chunk will focus solely on the equation lines.

Subsequent chunks will include the following text and closing phrases, and I plan to keep the total lines to a maximum of 8 per chunk. I’ll also finalize the dimensions based on the resolution, deciding on width=768 and height=997 to reflect a portrait orientation. Ultimately, I’m ensuring that the chunks correspond accurately to vertical and horizontal boundaries.
**Finalizing chunk boundaries and coordinates**

I've determined the chunk sizes to fit within the guideline of no more than eight lines of text per chunk. Chunk1 contains about 3 lines, Chunk2 has 2-3 math lines, Chunk3 includes 5-6 lines, Chunk4 has 3-4 lines with a signature, and Chunk5 contains 2 lines for the footnote. I’ve set specific y boundaries, ensuring no lines are cut off, and defined the chunks as follows:

(0, 0, 767, 250)  
(0, 230, 767, 420)  
(0, 410, 767, 650)  
(0, 640, 767, 840)  
(0, 830, 767, 996)  

Final resolution: (768, 997)
