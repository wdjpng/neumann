**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe the handwritten German fragment fully into HTML. It looks like it reads "also geht p^2 nicht in k^2 über) Ist Ihnen" or perhaps "geht p^2 nicht in q^2 über." I want to be careful since the top line might be cut off, and any partially cut-off lines should be ignored. So, I'll focus on the one complete line of text shown in the image. It seems like I'm on the right track!
**Analyzing the German phrase**

I'm examining the German phrase "also geht p^2 nicht in k^2 über) Ist Ihnen." It looks like there's a superscript '2' indicating squared for 'p' and potentially 'ρ' instead of 'p.' The whole phrase translates to "thus p^2 does not transform into k^2," which could be a reference to physics, maybe something about Lorentz transformation. I can clearly see "über" at the end and the phrase "Ist Ihnen" after a bracket. Also, there's an underlined "nicht," which I'll render with <u>.
**Interpreting the mathematical notation**

The user requests that I use MathJax for mathematical expressions. I'm looking closely at the phrase starting with "also geht." The first letter could be 'p' or possibly 'q,' but the scribble suggests it might be 'q^2' instead. Following "nicht in," there's "k^2," which could also be "h^2." I notice that the letters have interesting shapes, like the potential 'φ^2' for phi-squared. It looks like there are actually two superscript '2's above the letters 'pg'—I need to clarify that!
**Transcribing and interpreting the text**

The phrase "also geht p² g² nicht in h² über" needs careful scrutiny. I wonder if it might also read "geht p'g' nicht in h'²," but I’m not entirely sure. I see "p² g²" on the left of "nicht," which could also be "p² q²," suggesting two variables. The image shows "p² q²," though it's not underlined. After "in," the letter might be 'k,' 'h,' or 's.' It seems tricky, but the user wants an accurate and aesthetically pleasing transcription using MathJax, focusing on formatting rather than correctness.
**Crafting the HTML for transcription**

I'm thinking about how to handle the variables in the transcription. I could include generic symbols like '?' to represent uncertainty, but that might not be faithful to the original. I'll present the variables in italics, like "p²" and "k²." From my observations, "p²" doesn't transform into "q²," so it makes sense to go with "p² nicht in k² über." 

I need to ensure the formatting stays true to the original design, using MathJax for the mathematical expressions and maintaining a handwritten look. I’ll craft the necessary HTML with proper spacing and accents. Let's put this all together now!
