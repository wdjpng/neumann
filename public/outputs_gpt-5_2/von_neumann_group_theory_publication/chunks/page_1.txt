**Determining chunk guidelines**

I’m focusing on how to output the coordinates of chunks covering the handwritten letter's lines. The constraints about math lines don’t apply here since we’re avoiding equations. I want to aim for chunks no bigger than about 8 lines each and to ensure I cover the whole width of the letter page when it makes sense. 

I’ll also take note of the image resolution, which appears to be 982x768 based on the details in the prompt.
**Clarifying image dimensions**

I’m trying to confirm the image dimensions based on the note that indicates width and height. It seems like the orientation is portrait, which would mean the width is 768 pixels and the height is 982 pixels. The page occupies most of the image with some small margins. 

I need to propose rectangular chunks, keeping in mind the instruction for 2 to 10 of these chunks and making sure to use the full width of the letter page when it makes sense.
**Proposing chunks for the letter**

I’m thinking of proposing around 4 chunks for the handwritten letter. 

Chunk 1 would include the header lines like "Hs.91: 679" and "Zürich, den...," along with the greeting "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" I need to keep it under 8 lines for this chunk. 

I’ll count the lines carefully, starting with the greeting and noting subsequent lines. It seems I have to make sure I accurately balance the content while counting.
**Counting lines for chunking**

I'm continuing to analyze the letter, and it looks like there are about 19 lines in total when I include the header lines "Hs.91: 679" and "Zürich, den 30.6.1928." The main body itself contains approximately 17 lines. Since I need to break this into chunks of no more than 8 lines each, I’ll have to carefully select how to group these.

I’ll ensure the first chunk captures the header and some of the body while staying under that line limit.
**Creating bounding box coordinates**

I’m planning to split the content into 4 chunks, ensuring that each chunk has the right number of lines. The first chunk will cover the header lines, and I’ll measure y positions accordingly. The calculated y positions for the first chunk stretch from around 0 to 150, while the next chunks will cover the body of text.

To ensure all lines are contained, I’m setting the x values from 0 to 767 for the full width. I think that balancing the overlap between chunks is important to prevent any cropping of the text. My estimated bounding boxes will be:

- Chunk 1: (0, 0, 767, 150)
- Chunk 2: (0, 140, 767, 410)
- Chunk 3: (0, 400, 767, 660)
- Chunk 4: (0, 650, 767, 960)
**Finalizing chunk coordinates and resolution**

Alright, I need to ensure that my chunks align with the instruction saying "no chunk should contain more than two to four lines of mathematical expressions," but it's good that we don’t have any equations here. I’ll generate the coordinates for each of the four chunks, plus the overall resolution of the image.

I’ll set the coordinates:

- Chunk 1: (0, 0, 767, 150)
- Chunk 2: (0, 140, 767, 410)
- Chunk 3: (0, 400, 767, 660)
- Chunk 4: (0, 650, 767, 981)

And the resolution will be:

- Resolution: (768, 982)

This should ensure everything is covered well without extending too far into blank space.
