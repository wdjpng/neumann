**Determining bounding boxes for image chunks**

I need to create bounding boxes for the handwriting in an image, splitting it into two to ten rectangular sections. The instruction emphasizes equations, but there aren't any. I’ll divide the letter around eight lines of text per chunk, noting there are about 20 lines total. The page features a date and a note at the top, so I should include full width when reasonable. I also need to clarify the image resolution, which seems to be 982x768.
**Clarifying image resolution**

I’m figuring out the image orientation, which is showing as 982x768. But I wonder if it might actually be 768x982? The display notes "resolution 982 768," but it also mentions cropping, and I see that it’s labeled ambiguously. Typically, images show width first, but since this is a portrait letter, the width should be less than the height. So, I think the height is likely 982 and the width is 768, meaning I need to ensure these details match in my task.
**Establishing chunk dimensions**

I’m noting that with vertical smartphone images, the resolution often displays as “1080x1920,” where 1080 is the width and 1920 is the height. For the letter in portrait orientation, I think my dimensions are likely “width 768” and “height 982,” which matches the common letter ratio. This means I can assume width is 768 and height is 982, so my output will be “(768, 982).” Now, I’ll create 4 to 5 chunks to include the full width of the letter page while accounting for slight overlaps from slanted lines.
**Planning chunk overlap and layout**

I need to ensure that every line is fully contained in at least one chunk. If lines at the top or bottom are slanted near the margins, I can allow slight overlaps between adjacent vertical chunks. For this, I can use wide vertical padding. Looking closely at the image details, I see small notes at the top. The letter starts with "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" around y 200. I should stay within the bounding area of the page and include the full width of the letter while planning the chunks.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates and dimensions**

The image contains some border areas outside the page edges. The letter page width is about 640 px of the full 768 width, with 30 px grey side margins on each side. To ensure we meet the requirements, I’ll set the chunk width to the full image width, even though the main letter is more narrow. I’ll create 5 vertical chunks with overlaps to ensure all lines are included. Each chunk will account for around 4-6 lines of text and maintain appropriate overlaps for slanted lines. 

I'll establish the following coordinates for each chunk:  
1. (0, 0, 768, 230)  
2. (0, 180, 768, 410)  
3. (0, 380, 768, 620)  
4. (0, 600, 768, 830)  
5. (0, 800, 768, 982)  

Finally, I’ll confirm the overall resolution as (768, 982).
**Ensuring accuracy in dimensions**

I need to be very precise with the dimensions because if the width is incorrect, the output will be wrong. The image shows a "resolution 982 768," so I’m considering that the height could be 982 and the width 768. Since they want the final output as (width, height), I'll list it as (768, 982).

I’ll follow the instructions to provide the bounding boxes without heavy formatting, ensuring integer coordinates:  

(0, 0, 768, 230)  
(0, 180, 768, 410)  
(0, 380, 768, 620)  
(0, 600, 768, 830)  
(0, 800, 768, 982)  
(768, 982)  

Lastly, I’ll keep the overlaps at 50-60 px for coverage.
