**Transcribing handwriting**

I need to transcribe some German cursive handwriting. The text starts with "In der Hoffnung des Wiedersehens," which I can confirm. The next part seems to read "verbleibe ich Ihr sehr ergebener," which is a formal closing in German letters, possibly with "Ihr" or "Ihrer" being possessive. I'll go with "verbleibe ich Ihr sehr ergebener." The signature reads "J. v. Neumann," and the "v." is underlined. I’ll aim to present this nicely in HTML to capture the calligraphic style!
**Styling cursive text**

I need to style some cursive text using CSS. I'll use fonts like "Brush Script MT," "Segoe Script," and "Allura," with a color around #5a6a77 since the ink is grey-blue. I could create a container with a paper-like background gradient, but I want to keep the HTML simple. It’s important to include the line breaks as they appear in the original text. There are three lines, and I’ll ignore any that are partially cut off, especially at the margins where the first line begins.
**Crafting HTML for transcription**

The lines I'm transcribing are fully visible, which is great! I’ll use a `<div>` with `<p>` elements for structure. They asked to include italics and a script style, along with MathJax for any math expressions, but there aren't any present here. 

For the HTML, I’ll set up a minimal layout with a parchment background color (#efe9d5) and use grey cursive text. I'll keep the three line breaks and maybe emphasize the signature line with a subtle overline on the "v." using a border-top. I'll ensure everything is neatly spaced with an appropriate line height!
