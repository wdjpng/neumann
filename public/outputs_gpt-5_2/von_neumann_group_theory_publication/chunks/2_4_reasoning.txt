**Transcribing handwritten text**

I'm working on transcribing text from an image of a handwritten German sentence with a footnote marker "*1." It says: "*1 Ich glaube, dass man hieraus schliessen sollte, dass die physikalischen Grössen nicht als Funktionen von p und q zu beschreiben sind." 

I need to ensure accurate reading, checking for diacritics and spelling. "Grössen" reflects the old Swiss use, and "schliessen" is with 'ss' instead of 'ß.' The handwriting indicates "schliessen" is correct. Also, there's a comma after "glaube." Everything looks good!
**Formatting the transcription**

I see that there’s another comma after "sollte," and then follows "dass." 

For "von p und q," I should use MathJax to render \(p\) and \(q\). I can embed them like <span class="math">\(p\)</span> or use inline \(p\) \(q\). Usually, MathJax is straightforward if it’s loaded correctly. 

I should also keep the line breaks as they appear in the image. There's a horizontal line above "*1," but since they asked to ignore any partially cut-off lines, I'll leave that out.
**Preparing the text format**

The text is a single line, and I'll design a reproduction that mimics the handwriting style while keeping the formatting as close as possible. To make it pretty, I’ll use a styled block with a cursive font to simulate handwriting.

I can create a container with a faint background to resemble paper. For the footnote marker "*1," I’ll use <sup>*1</sup> at the beginning of the line, followed by the text. They want to maintain the "*1" format without any footnote anchor, but making it look nice is allowed. I'll keep the line as one, possibly adding a <br> at the end.
**Creating the HTML structure**

I need to include the German 'ß' and type "Grössen" correctly. They did mention ignoring partially cut-off lines, but it looks like there aren't any. 

I'll craft the HTML code now. It seems safe to include a minimal head section even if they only want the HTML. I'll add a script tag for MathJax to render \(p\) and \(q\). Since they want it in HTML, I can also include a CSS style to mimic handwriting and an underlined header. 

To represent the horizontal line from the image, I’ll create a div at the top with specific styles for a thin line. That sounds good!
**Finalizing the HTML layout**

I’m adding a container with a width of around 1000 px to match the screenshot, making it dynamic. The text will be a single line and include a superscript marker "*1" after some commas. I need to ensure I only include the HTML output with no extraneous commentary.

Here’s my HTML structure so far: I’ll add a top line, style the text with specific fonts and background colors, and ensure that the font is readable. The marker will stay as "*1" instead of superscript to match the original style. 

I'll set the CSS to maintain spacing and keep it all on one line!
