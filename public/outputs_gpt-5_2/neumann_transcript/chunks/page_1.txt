**Organizing the document**

I need to split the page into manageable chunks since it's a document with text lines and some small equations, but those equations are not math-related. The guideline suggests using around eight lines per chunk and including the full width of the letter page when possible. So, I’ll create vertical slices across the width. I plan to make about 6-7 sections: header, name line, address line, a table heading, course list, ID lines, and lower exam table notes. The image resolution is 1106 x 768, so I'll need the coordinates as integers.
**Confirming image dimensions**

Okay, the resolution shows 1106 by 768. I need to remember that in the output, I should list width first and then height. So, it looks like the width is 768 and the height is 1106 based on this format. The text confirms this. I’ll also specify bounding boxes to include the whole width of each chunk whenever it seems reasonable. I’m considering using x1=40 for alignment in the output. This should help me structure the chunks correctly.
**Defining chunk dimensions**

Okay, I need to include the whole width of each printed letter page, which means considering the margins around the page in the image. It’s safer to use the full width of the image itself. I’m thinking of setting x1=0 and x2=767 for the inclusive coordinates. The bottom-right coordinate should be the pixel index, so I’ll set it as image width minus one (767) and height minus one (1105). 

Also, I must ensure that every line of text fits in at least one bounding box, so if needed, I can overlap some chunks. In this case, though, the lines are straight, so I don’t have to worry about splitting anything mathematical since there aren’t any. I think I’ll create about 7 chunks overall.
**Creating chunk sections**

I’m starting with the top header area, which includes "Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule" and the "Matrikel" title. This section is likely from y 60 to 260, so I'll set the coordinates from 0 to 265 to cover it. 

Next, I’ll look at the name line, which is styled in big cursive, and the address line below. This area should stretch from y 260 to 355. There's also the "Abteilung IV" section starting around y 370, and I’ll be careful not to overlap incorrectly. To ensure all lines are captured, I might overlap a bit between 2-3 chunks.

For the "Abteilung IV" heading and the semester lines, the table stretches from around y 360 to 900. I can break this area into multiple bands since there are more than 8 lines. The first section will include "Abteilung IV" and the first two semester lines, "I. Semester Winter" and "II. Semester Sommer." I’ll include also some early lines within this section.
**Structuring the document into chunks**

The instructions suggest no more than eight lines per chunk, focusing on text rather than math. So, for Chunk 3, I'll capture the "Abteilung IV" heading along with some semester lines, while counting the relevant lines to prevent splits. 

Considering the details, here's how I'm structuring it:

- **Chunk 1** will cover the top header, name line, and address line from y 0 to 340.
- **Chunk 2** will include the "Abteilung IV" heading and parts of the semester table.
- Chunks 3 to 7 will be dedicated to the semester courses and related lines while ensuring no more than eight lines are included in each.
- **Chunk 8** will cover the exam table area, splitting it into two to manage the number of lines accordingly.

I'm planning to use full width for all chunks but ensure I'm respecting the boundaries where necessary to keep everything intact!
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I’ve defined my chunks more clearly now! For Chunk 1, the coordinates will be from y 0 to 345, incorporating the header. Chunk 2 will cover y 330 to 575, including the relevant course lines. 

Continuing the pattern, I’ll set the other chunks as follows:  
- Chunk 3: (0, 565, 767, 700)  
- Chunk 4: (0, 690, 767, 810)  
- Chunk 5: (0, 800, 767, 895)  
- Chunk 6: (0, 885, 767, 1015)  
- Chunk 7: (0, 1005, 767, 1105)  

For the resolution, it’ll be (768, 1106). So my final output will be these coordinates, concluding with that resolution.
