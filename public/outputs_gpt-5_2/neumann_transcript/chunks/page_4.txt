**Deciphering resolution details**

I’m trying to understand the phrase “resolution 1117 768 look.” It seems like it’s referring to dimensions where height is 1117 pixels and width is 768 pixels, possibly indicating a typical portrait layout. The alt text is a bit more complicated, with the extra numbers making it hard to parse. I need to confirm how these dimensions relate to overall image resolution and whether they consistently represent height followed by width. It's a bit tricky!
**Clarifying image resolution and chunking**

It looks like the numbers 1117 and 768 refer to height and width, respectively, since the instructions say to output the resolution in the format (width, height). So, width is 768 px and height is 1117 px. I want to make sure that every line fits properly within these dimensions, accounting for potential overlap and ensuring we don’t crop the image. We should consider the entire width of the letters while noting the vertical margins. Using the full image width seems reasonable!
**Organizing text into chunks**

I need to make sure I include all text lines and account for small margins. To be safe, I’ll set the left edge at x1=0 and the right edge at x2=767, dealing with any background border later. I think I can divide the content into five horizontal chunks. 

The first chunk can be the header with the title "Abteilung IV." and "2. Kurs 1933-1934." The second chunk will cover the table header row with the column titles and a few lines of items, while keeping to a limit of around eight lines per chunk. I just have to avoid exceeding those limits!
**Planning chunk distribution**

I want to plan for about eight lines per chunk. It looks like there are roughly 20 rows, so I can allocate one chunk for the header and four chunks for the content above "W.-S. Freifächer," breaking the table into 3-4 segments. 

The page content shows a large bordered table with a "Fachgegenstände" list on the left, dashed columns on the right, and handwritten course names at the bottom. I can define my chunks based on these observations, starting from just below the header up to various points along the table.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I'm organizing the data into six chunks, aiming for about eight lines per chunk while ensuring all text lines are fully contained. The top header and table content will be split carefully to avoid cutting lines in half. I'll rely on approximate y coordinates, setting clear boundaries to achieve this. 

I want to ensure overlaps of around 20 pixels at the edges to capture any tilted lines, especially for the 'Freifächer' area. I’ll finalize the bounding boxes with precise coordinates and check line counts to confirm they meet the requirements!
