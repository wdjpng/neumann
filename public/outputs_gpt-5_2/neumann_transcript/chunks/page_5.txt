**Structuring chunk output**

I need to create bounding boxes that split content into manageable chunks, limiting to 3-4 lines of equations per chunk. However, since this is a table or list and not math, the focus is on text lines. The goal is to chunk lines into 6-10 horizontal slices while maintaining full width on the letter page when possible. I should also consider curved text lines and allow overlap between chunks to ensure complete lines are captured within the defined area.
**Clarifying image resolution**

The image resolution is noted as 1106x768, with the height at 1106 pixels and the width at 768 pixels. I need to report width as 768 and height as 1106. The goal is to ensure every line of text is fully captured, so I’ll create horizontal slices spanning from the left border at 0 to the right border at 767. I must also account for any margins, so I’ll make sure to avoid including too many lines per chunk while following this approach.
**Planning table chunking**

The table has numerous rows, and if I create about 8-10 horizontal slices, each will contain around 8-10 rows. The constraint regarding mathematical expressions doesn’t apply here since there are none. The goal is to respect the limit of 2-4 lines in each chunk. I’m thinking of making around 8 chunks. The layout includes a header at the top with "Abteilung IV" and a table header, followed by course rows and teacher names, along with semester indicators. Lastly, there's a bottom section to consider.
**Estimating coordinates for table sections**

I need to focus on the section labeled "Freifächer S.-S." and the handwritten lines for free electives, which seem to take up about 120-200 pixels. The page might be slightly tilted, and overlaps are allowed, so I’ll create delineations with vertical ranges. While I can’t inspect pixel values exactly, I can estimate by examining the layout. The top margin is around 40 pixels, and the height is 1106 pixels. Based on my estimates, the header ends around y 160, the table body starts around y 170, and the free elective area begins around y 930.
**Defining chunk coordinates**

The table extends to the bottom area, from y 940 to 1030, leading to blank space at the bottom. I’m proposing to create 6 or 7 chunks since full width is preferred, with x coordinates from 0 to 767. The chunking plan includes defining y coordinates for each section. I'm considering overlaps of about 10-20 pixels to ensure full line coverage without exceeding 8 lines of text per chunk. 

After weighing various boundaries, I’ve settled on 7 chunks, ensuring every line of text is fully included. Let’s finalize the coordinates and output the chunks along with the resolution.
