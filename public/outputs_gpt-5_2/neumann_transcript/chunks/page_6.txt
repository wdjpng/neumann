**Analyzing page width and chunking**

I'm trying to ensure I include the entire width of each letter page, which simplifies to using x1=0 and x2=768. 

For the main table area, it spans from y  145 to y  670. The table has five text entries in the left column along with some teacher names, no math, and might stretch to around 8 lines total. 

The "Freifächer" row at the bottom has four handwritten lines and should be included too, even though it leans left. 

Lastly, I’m considering the footer area but might skip that. Let's determine y coordinates numerically.
**Defining page chunks**

I’m considering the layout for the header, setting the chunk from y1=40 to y2=170. 

Next, the main table will span from around y=170 to 740. 

For the "Freifächer" lines, I see they fit between 880 and 1060, but there's also the "W.-S. Freifächer S.-S." printed around y=800. I think I should create a chunk for that line and the handwritten notes below. 

To avoid splitting lines, I'll set chunk 2's bottom at 740 and start chunk 3 from 740, adding a 20 px overlap for safety.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I've set chunk 2's bottom at 780 and chunk 3's top at 750. Here are the output lines:

- (0, 30, 768, 180)  // for the header
- (0, 170, 768, 780) // for the main table
- (0, 750, 768, 1117) // for the "Freifächer" lines

I need to ensure that everything is contained within those chunks to avoid any splits. The header includes "Abteilung IV." at y=75 and "4. Kurs 19 25-1926" around y=105, so that’s accounted for. 

Let’s finalize this with just the coordinates. I’ll output the final chunk list now.
**Formatting final output**

I’ve settled on the following chunk coordinates:

1) (0, 40, 768, 180)
2) (0, 170, 768, 780)
3) (0, 750, 768, 1117)

For the last line, I’ll provide the resolution format: (768, 1117).

I just realized I need to ensure that I’m including parentheses around each entry as instructed. It’s important to follow this format so I end up with everything properly structured. Alright, let’s get that output ready!
