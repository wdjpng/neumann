**Considering chunk overlaps**

I'm looking at the risk of including a portion of the "DIPLOM als" line. The request is clear: avoid splitting lines unless overlaps are necessary for context. While having overlaps can help, it’s still best to prevent them if I can ensure every line and mathematical expression fits completely within a single chunk. So, I plan to set y2 just below the table bottom while keeping in mind the limits of each chunk.
**Refining chunk coordinates**

I need to make sure both lines are fully included, so I'm checking the positions. The second line ends around y=565, which means setting y2 to 610 sounds good. The instruction about including the entire width per letter page suggests I should set x1 to 0 and x2 to 767 for both. Although cropping to the inner border width is sometimes preferred, I’ll use the entire image width this time. So, chunk coordinates will need refinement, and I'll provide those as integer pairs.
**Setting chunk parameters**

I'm starting at y=0 to include the top header "Diplomprüfungen," which is around y=60, so that works. For chunk 2, I've got the coordinates as (0, 440, 767, 620). It's important to ensure every line fits entirely within one chunk. The table header and rows will be in chunk 1, while the two lines go in chunk 2. 

I'll confirm the y-values: y2 for chunk 1 seems safe at 440. Now, let’s produce the final output with each chunk’s coordinates and resolution. 

Here’s my final output:  
(0, 0, 767, 440)  
(0, 440, 767, 620)  
(767, 620)
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I noticed that the "Note: 5,55" text is on the same line as "DIPLOM als," which means it should be included in chunk 2, and that’s good. I considered adding a third chunk, but it doesn’t seem necessary. There's a potential edge case with a vertical binding line near the right border, but it’s not an issue for now. 

I want to ensure everything lines up properly: I’m setting the width to 768 and the height to 1117. For chunk coordinates, here’s the resolved set:

(0, 0, 767, 440)  
(0, 441, 767, 620)
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I want to ensure no line is clipped, especially since the table bottom border might be at y=430. This means I’ll set chunk 1’s y2 to 448. For chunk 2, starting y1 at 440 could create a shared boundary, which might include blank space. I think it’s better to create a slight gap or tiny overlap to avoid splitting your text. 

To be cautious and still ensure everything is contained, I’ll set chunk 2’s y1 to 441. Here's the final output:

Chunk 1: (0, 0, 767, 448)  
Chunk 2: (0, 440, 767, 620)  
Resolution: (768, 1117)
