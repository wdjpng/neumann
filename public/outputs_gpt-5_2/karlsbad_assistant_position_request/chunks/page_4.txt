**Analyzing image chunks**

I need to split the image into rectangular chunks that contain text lines and math expressions. The letter is handwritten with some math scribbles at the top, so I’m aiming for 2-10 chunks, as long as I don’t create too many. Each chunk should ideally keep the whole width of the letter page when it's reasonable. I have to ensure no more than 3-4 lines of equations per chunk while being careful about where math occurs. I'll determine the positions of the lines as I go.
**Structuring text and math chunks**

I need to analyze the image further, as there are multiple lines of math near the top, followed by text paragraphs. I’ll create chunks starting with Chunk 1, which will include the header and math portion across the page width. This chunk should have at most 3-4 lines of equations. After examining, the lines include “Q(f*, g*) = ...” and equations like “T* f* = f*” and “T* = ∫ dE(λ)”. That gives me at least three equations to work with, so I’ll ensure to include these along with the preceding text in the chunk.
**Mapping chunk coordinates**

I need to remember that the guidelines state no more than 2-4 lines of math per chunk, and since I determined I have 3 lines, Chunk 1 should include everything up to the end of that equation block. I'm estimating that this region is around y 0-350, so I'll need to inspect the image closely for exact coordinates. The top margin is about 35 px, and the math lines start around y 60. 

So, I'm thinking of defining:

- Chunk 1: y 0 to roughly 300 for the top math equations.
- Chunk 2: the following text paragraph from after the equations, up to around mid-page, containing about 6-8 text lines between y 300 and 700.
**Defining additional chunks**

I need to ensure each line is properly contained within the designated chunks. For Chunk 3, I’ll capture another text block further down, and Chunk 4 will include the closing lines and the P.S. at the bottom. I must keep track of the lines to maintain the limit of no more than 8 lines of text per chunk. 

It’s essential to prioritize the equations, but we can keep around 6-8 lines of text too. I see that below the equations is a parenthetical sentence, followed by continued paragraphs — likely around 20 lines total to the bottom. I’ll split this into three text chunks and include the full width of the page where reasonable. I’ll set x1=0 and x2=767 to fit the entire width, making sure not to include anything outside the margins. I’ll also ensure the coordinates are integers.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I need to ensure proper chunk creation while allowing for some overlap, especially since the handwritten lines might slope slightly. I’m calculating the y breakpoints for accurate segmenting:

- For Chunk 1, I’ll set y1=0 and y2=360 to include the top header and math equations.
- Chunk 2 will cover y1=340 to 700 for text lines, ensuring a 20 px overlap to avoid cutting mid-line.
- Chunk 3 will be y1=680 to 980, and Chunk 4 will range from y1=960 to 1237 for closing lines and the P.S.

I’m verifying that I don’t split any math lines, maintaining my equations mostly in the first chunk while keeping in mind the maximum lines per chunk. I’ll finalize the output as:

(0, 0, 767, 360)  
(0, 340, 767, 700)  
(0, 680, 767, 980)  
(0, 960, 767, 1237)

And for the image resolution, I’ll remember to include it as (768, 1238).
