**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe all the text from the image into HTML while maintaining the original formatting and line breaks. I’ll ignore any partially cut-off lines, as I’ll focus on capturing everything clearly. Although there are no math expressions, I’ll keep in mind to create a stylized letter-like body using a cursive font. 

I’ll include CSS to mimic handwriting, ensuring I've got the HTML code neatly organized, and replicate any necessary formatting like underlines or dashes. Let's decipher the content!
**Deciphering handwritten text**

I see that the text at the top left edge is cut off, but the instruction is clear: I should ignore partially cut-off lines. The top line seems mid-sentence but is visible across its width. 

It starts with "an den," and after examining it, the term "Operatoren-Kalkül" likely follows. There's also a blue scribble that says "die ich," but it’s crossed out. So, I think the line reads: "an den quantenmechanischen Operatoren-Kalkül beschäftigt — und, wie ich glaube, zu." I’ll keep going!
**Transcribing more lines**

For Line 2, the phrase looks to be "Kalkül beschäftigt — und, wie ich glaube, zu," which seems correct. Moving to Line 3, it’s likely "einem gewissen Abschluss gebracht — habe." 

I notice a long dash in that line, so it could indeed be "— habe." Line 4 appears to start with, "Es ist die Frage der Formulierung und Er-" and there's a hyphen, followed by "ledigung." 

Line 5 continues with "ledigung des Eigenwertproblems für allge-." For Line 6, it seems to include the phrase "(insbesondere nicht-beschränkte!)" with quotes around "nicht-beschränkte" for emphasis. I think I'm on the right track!
**Continuing the transcription**

At the end of Line 6, there's a closing parenthesis, and then I see Line 7: "symmetrische Operatoren, in dem Sinne, wie sie." This might be the last visible line, as the bottom margin could continue beyond the screenshot. 

I’ll ignore any lines that are partially cut off, but I'll make sure "allgemeine" is spelled correctly. The previous line shows "allge-" and "meine," which indicates it's part of "allgemeine (insbesondere..."

I need to ensure "Kalkül" is spelled with the Umlaut "ü." The first line also makes sense with the hyphen. Everything is coming together!
**Crafting the HTML letter**

I see that there's a hyphenation in "Er-" leading into "ledigung" across Lines 4 and 5. I need to ensure the arrangement matches the letter format, opting for left alignment.

I’ll note that the topmost and bottom lines are fully visible, so now it's time to construct the HTML. I plan to include a link to the Google Font "Caveat” and ensure appropriate fallbacks. We’ll mimic line breaks to retain the original formatting closely and set max-width for line control.

I’ll carefully embed all content and finalize the letter style, keeping everything neat and organized!
