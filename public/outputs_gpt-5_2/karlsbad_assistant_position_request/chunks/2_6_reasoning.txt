**Working on HTML formatting**

I see that the snippet includes some references to handwritten styles, like "f*" or "f^*". Since the request is to "make it pretty," I think I should use a styled <div> with a handwritten-like font, if I can find one. However, to keep the formatting close to the original with line breaks, using a <pre> block might be better. I should also consider adding some CSS for margins and background. I'll include details like the em-dash and parentheses while keeping "f^*" formatted with MathJax, which appears appropriate.
**Analyzing the MathJax usage**

I see that in MathJax, I can represent "f*" as \(f^\*\), which looks good. I should also consider how it fits into the context of the lines I’m working with. The first line reads: “endlich ist, so gibt es ein (und nur ein) f^*”, and I want to clarify if “f” could also just be “f+”. There's a scribble before it, possibly hinting at more context. Then, for the second line "— es werden mir solche mit endlichem," I'm debating on whether "endlichem" could be spelled "endlichen", since the last letter seems uncertain.
**Clarifying the lines and formatting**

I’m analyzing the phrases and trying to get them just right. It looks like "mit endlich vielen" could be common, but the last word doesn't seem to match; it’s probably "endlichem" instead. The shape of the last part looks like "em," which seems right. I see "werden mir" is indeed what I’m reading. 

For my lines, I want them as follows:  
Line 1: "endlich ist, so gibt es ein (und nur ein) f^{*}"  
Line 2: "— es werden mir solche mit endlichem"  

Plus, they mentioned underlining "endlich," so it needs to be formatted correctly, especially beneath the relevant phrases!
**Finalizing formatting details**

In the second line, I notice a long underline that might start just before "es." The instruction is to keep the formatting close, but I’m seeing it may not be clear. I think I’ll skip the underline altogether since it's ambiguous. Instead, I can italicize the entire text to give it that handwritten style. 

I'll set up the font-family to something like "Georgia" or "Times New Roman," using CSS, and apply a soft paper background for aesthetics. Plus, I need to remember to include the MathJax script for rendering \(f^{\*}\).
**Crafting the final HTML with MathJax**

The user wants to utilize MathJax for mathematical expressions, so I’ll embed the MathJax script from a CDN. However, since the platform may not support remote scripts, I'll include the typical script. It's essential to ensure that only HTML code is produced. For the styling, I'll set up a body background of #f5f1e8 and use a container styled to look like a handwritten letter. 

I'll format the lines using a <pre class="handwritten"> tag with appropriate styles for font, color, and sizing while making sure the MathJax renders properly. The output will follow the specifications without including extraneous elements.
