**Splitting handwritten text**

I need to divide the handwritten German letter into rectangular chunks, focusing on the text. The instructions say to limit each chunk to about eight lines, but there are no mathematical expressions or equations present. The page likely has around 28 lines total. I'll inspect the image resolution of 768x1226, ensuring the chunks fit well while possibly using the entire page width where sensible. It seems best to use a width range of 40 to 728 pixels.
**Determining chunk width and height**

Alright, I want to ensure I'm including the full width of the letter, so from 0 to 767 pixels, even though the instructions mention the width of the letter page. It’s fine to use the entire image width since the coordinates should be in the original image. I need to create chunks that span both width and height, allowing for overlaps to account for any slanted lines. 

I’m planning for about 5 or 6 chunks with 6 to 8 lines each, while identifying the y-coordinates since the image height is 1226 pixels.
**Planning chunk coordinates**

I'm breaking down the handwritten letter into chunks based on the y-coordinates. The first chunk captures the header area from y=0 to around y=200, which includes the printed "Hotel Bristol," addresses, and date line. Then, I’ll chunk the body lines from y=190 to y=400 and follow that with several more chunks, each overlapping slightly by 20-40 pixels to make sure every handwritten line is fully included.

I’m considering using the full image width from x=0 to 767 to ensure all text is captured, while keeping an eye on the page edges.
**Clarifying coordinates and segmentation**

I'm thinking about the coordinates for capturing the handwritten letter. Since the width is given as 768, I recognize that using 0 to 767 would be standard for inclusive coordinates with x2=767 and y2=1225 for height. The recommendation to include the whole width of the letter page is important, even if it brings in some background. I’m considering whether to set x1 and x2 to 40 and 730 for a better match, but using the full width might ensure I include all lines.

Next, I need to inspect specific y positions. The top margin is around y=0 to 28, followed by the printed header until about y=180. This header includes various printed lines and some small text in the corner, but these aren’t "math expressions," so I'll stick to the limit of eight lines.
**Setting chunk coordinates**

The header includes about 4-5 lines, so I’ll set the first chunk from y=0 to y=230. The main body starts at around y=220 with the first line being "Sehr geehrter..." I estimate around 8 lines per chunk, aiming for 6 chunks overall. I’ll define approximate boundaries with an overlap of 20 px to avoid splitting any lines. 

After finalizing the y-coordinates, here’s the breakdown for each chunk along with the resolution line:

(0, 0, 767, 230)  
(0, 210, 767, 420)  
(0, 400, 767, 610)  
(0, 590, 767, 800)  
(0, 780, 767, 990)  
(0, 970, 767, 1225)  
(768, 1226)
