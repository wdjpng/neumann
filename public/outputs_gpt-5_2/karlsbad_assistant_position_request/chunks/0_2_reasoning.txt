**Interpreting handwritten text**

I'm considering the handwritten text where "re" might be part of a word split without a hyphen. The image shows "3 Jahr" followed by a scribble. The second line begins with "Jahre" clearly, so it seems they just broke "Jahre" across lines. The scribble could indicate that break. Given the ambiguity, I think we won't use strikethrough but present it as text across a line break. 

I believe we should include that line break as part of the formatting.
**Transcribing handwritten lines**

I'm continuing my read-through of the handwritten lines. The next line shows "ich informiert bin, im kommenden Herbst," and then it mentions "wieder Vakanz eintritt." There's also the line starting with "Da wohl mit gros-," indicating it might be hyphenating "großer." 

I plan to transcribe them line by line, starting with:

Line 1: "stuhl der Universität Berlin, die alle 3 Jah"
Line 2: "re vergeben wird, und bei der, wie"
Line 3: "ich informiert bin, im kommenden Herbst"
Line 4: "wieder Vakanz eintritt."
Line 5: "Da wohl mit gros-"

It looks like they may be breaking words across lines, especially with "groß."
**Analyzing line content**

I'm examining the handwritten text where the line shows "Da wohl mit gros-" and there's a small superscript '3' above "groß." Line 5 reads "Da wohl mit gros-," and line 6 continues with "ser Wahrscheinlichkeit anzunehmen ist, dass." 

For line 7, it starts with "Prof. Sch...", and it may continue with "wieder nach Berlin." However, the bottom line appears cut off, so we should ignore any partially cut lines. The topmost line is cut off at the top, and I’m checking if others are cut on the left or right.
**Evaluating line visibility**

I'm looking closely at the handwritten notes, noting that the right side is cut near the margin, but the lines are complete horizontally. The bottom line might also be cut off; however, it’s still fully visible. 

According to the instructions, we should ignore lines that are partially cut. This includes the topmost and potentially the bottommost lines. The bottom line "kommt" isn’t fully visible. Since we only see parts of letters on that line, it might be best to ignore it. The seventh line shows "Prof. Sch..." and the next line should say "... nach Berlin."
**Preparing HTML for transcription**

I’m analyzing the details for the transcription. It seems the bottom-most line shows "... nach Berlin," but the cropping might affect our read. Given the instructions to ignore partially cut lines, I’ll focus on the clearly visible segments.

The full lines I’ll include are: 
- "re vergeben wird, und bei der, wie"
- "ich informiert bin, im kommenden Herbst"
- "wieder Vakanz eintritt."
- "Da wohl mit gros-"
- "ser Wahrscheinlichkeit anzunehmen ist, dass"

I will keep punctuation as is and ensure to include the correct accents, like 'Universität'. Although the line starting with "Prof." appears cut off, I should exclude it based on the guidelines. Now, I’ll create an HTML representation while preserving format and style.
**Finalizing HTML code**

I need to ensure that I'm only providing the HTML code. I’ll craft a simple style for the body with a light gray background (#f0f0f0) and a container width of 900 px with a softer background (#faf7e8). I'll use a border and drop shadow, and incorporate a script for MathJax. 

The `<pre>` will be styled with a cursive font to mimic handwriting, with a font size of 20px and a color of #2c4a72. 

For line breaks at "Jah/re," I’ll represent it with a new line without a hyphen. I've confirmed I'm including all fully visible text from the image. Now, I'll finalize the code.
