**Processing image chunks**

I need to output rectangles for chunks in an image of a handwritten German letter page. My goal is to split the page into rectangular chunks, aiming for about 8 lines of text each. Since the page is in portrait orientation, it might make sense to create 4 vertical chunks, covering the full width. I'll allow some overlaps since the lines aren't perfectly straight, and I’ll output the coordinates for each chunk based on the resolution of 768x1230.
**Verifying rectangle dimensions**

I'm checking the typical widths and heights for the rectangles. I’ve assumed a width of 768 pixels and a height of 1230 pixels. To ensure I include the margins while excluding the borders, I might set the x-coordinates around 35 to 740. However, it seems safer to use the full page width; thus, I'll go with x1=0 and x2=768. For clarity on coordinates, I will use pixel values: x2=767 and y2=1229 while adhering to the required dimensions.
**Choosing coordinates and splits**

I need to consider that many tasks require using numeric integers. I’m sticking with an inclusive approach for the pixel coordinates, so I’ll set x2 to 767 and y2 to 1229 based on the typical conventions in computer vision. I’ll output the resolution as (768, 1230) and ensure the rectangles span the full width from x1=0 to x2=767. For vertical splits, I estimate around 26 lines of text start below the top margin. Let's move forward with that!
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I’m going to divide the text into 4 chunks, aiming for around 6-8 lines each while considering the total height of 1230 pixels. The handwriting begins after about an 80-pixel top margin, and there's a header with a page number that I might choose not to count. For the first chunk, I’ll set boundaries from y1=70 to y2=345 to capture the text correctly. Then, I’ll define subsequent chunks at y1=330 to y2=630, y1=615 to y2=905, and y1=890 to y2=1229, allowing a little overlap for consistency.
**Finalizing chunk dimensions**

I’m working on establishing the chunks without exceeding 8 lines each, which means I’ll aim for heights between 275 and 300 pixels. Considering the handwriting and approximately 29 lines of text, I'll divide them into 4 chunks. To include the header with the page number "12," I'll begin chunk 1 from y1=0 to y2=330. I’ll define the overlaps to avoid splitting lines, aiming for about 50 pixels. Here are the final boundaries:  

(0, 0, 767, 330)  
(0, 300, 767, 640)  
(0, 610, 767, 930)  
(0, 900, 767, 1229)  
(768, 1230)
