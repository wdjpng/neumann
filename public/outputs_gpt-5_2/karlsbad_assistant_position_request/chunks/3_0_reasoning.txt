**Considering letter choices**

I'm a bit worried that the letter might actually be D instead of Q. The formula involves Q interacting with phi, which is important! But even if I've made a mistake, it's okay. I just need to focus on crafting the response effectively. Whether it's D or Q, I can adapt as I go along. Iâ€™m committed to getting this right!
