**Crafting HTML for Math**

I'm thinking about crafting some HTML with a nice typeface and maybe including a styled blockquote or monospaced text to keep line breaks intact. It should be pretty but not too heavy, perhaps using a <div style>. I need math delimiters for the inline math symbols. 

I want to finalize my text about the scalar product without making errors in terminology, like using proper plural forms and spacing in phrases.
**Finalizing Mathematical Text**

I’ve decided to use "Raume" but am weighing whether to go with "Funktionräumen" or "Funktionräume." It seems "Funktionräumen" is a bit unnatural. 

Since the visible writing includes "im Hilbertschen Raume Σ f_n g_n; im Funktionsräumen ∫ f·g·dv," I might stick with the plural form "Funktionsräumen." The original text had some diacritics, which felt a bit awkward. 

In the end, I’ll render it as: "im Hilbertschen Raume ∑ f_n g_n; im Funktionenraum ∫ f · g · dv), Q(f,f) = Q(f)!" with an exclamation mark to emphasize it.
**Generating HTML Code with MathJax**

I’m planning to create an HTML snippet using a nice script-like font, possibly with CSS like ‘cursive.’ The instructions emphasize keeping the formatting close to the original, so I’ll present a centered line. 

I’ll create a container in a `<div class="page">` for a single line of text and an italic paragraph to mimic handwriting. Since the user wants MathJax for rendering expressions, I’ll include the necessary script from a CDN. My final output will consist of complete HTML code, including the DOCTYPE, head, and MathJax configuration.
**Creating a Simple HTML Document**

I'm producing an HTML document for a transcription. It starts with the necessary DOCTYPE and includes a head section with charset and title. I plan to add the MathJax script using a CDN for rendering mathematical expressions.

In the style section, I want a handwriting-like or serif font, a cream background, and consistent line height. The main content in the body will feature a line of text containing mathematical expressions, formatted with MathJax, ensuring I use a `<div class="line">`. Let’s finalize this!
