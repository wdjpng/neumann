**Transcribing German text**

I'm trying to figure out how to transcribe a German phrase accurately. The last word might be "Manuskripte" with an archaic ending. I'm considering how "meinem" could fit into older German grammar as well, but it's unclear since "Manuskripte" is typically plural. I need to focus on accurately transcribing what's there, not correcting the grammar. There are also curious flourishes in the handwriting that are tricky to interpret, like a potentially lowercase 'quantenmechanischen' and a superscripted glyph.
**Analyzing French and notation**

I'm looking at the phrase "en moyenne," which means "on average" in French. It seems he might be writing something like "stetig (d. h. E(n) en moyenne)." I think "E(n)" likely stands for expected value, but "E(f)" could be a possibility too. There's a small superscript that could be a 4 or a caret. The phrase, however, "stetig (d. h. E(n) en moyenne)" doesn't quite make sense to me. I need to be cautious about transcription and pay attention to any partially visible text above the first line.
**Transcribing visible text**

I see some small bluish scribbles behind the visible lines, but the focus should be on three clear lines. The first line reads: "... stetig (d. h. E(n) en moyenne) — meine." However, I wonder if there’s a partially cut-off word before "stetig." The visible left margin doesn't show anything cut. The instruction is to ignore any text that's partially visible, including faint mirrored text. After "E(n)," there seems to be something like "4," and I might consider using MathJax to render mathematical expressions, like \(E(n)\), for clarity.
**Formatting transcription**

The phrase "en moyenne" is plain text, and there's a long dash followed by "meine" on the far right. The second line states, "Terminologie ist dieselbe, wie in meinem," and the third line reads, "Quantenmechanischen Manuskripte." I want to maintain line breaks and consider italicizing foreign words, though it’s not strictly necessary. To style it nicely, I could use a handwriting-like font, but there’s no header present. I might wrap it in a `<div class="letter">` and use MathJax to render "E(n)" as \(E(n)\) for clarity. I’ll keep the parentheses in the final transcription.
**Creating HTML transcription**

I'm analyzing the notation for MathJax to make sure everything is clear. The notation appears to be "E(f)" rather than "E(n)," with "n" unclear. There's context around "Quantenmechanischen," suggesting it's physics-related. I want to ensure accurate transcription while avoiding any misrepresentation. I’ll write HTML code that includes MathJax to render expressions, maintaining appropriate styling and formatting. The CSS will mimic a handwritten look, and I’ll include a subtle background color for readability while ensuring no extraneous text is added.
