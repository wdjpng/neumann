**Transcribing math to HTML**

I need to transcribe the image to HTML while maintaining the formatting and use MathJax for the math parts. The image has "Wenn" in German, meaning "if," followed by an integral sign suggesting the limits from minus infinity. The upper limit is shown as "∞." So, I should encode it as ∫_{-∞}^{∞}. The integrand appears to be "λ^2 dφ(E(λ) ξ," and it seems like there should be a closing bracket at the end.
**Clarifying the math expression**

I’m considering that it might say “dφ(E(λ) ξ).” Let’s zoom in! The image shows “d φ (E(λ) ξ,” but I'm unsure if there's a closing bracket. Based on typical spectral theorem notation, it might involve integrating λ^2 dφ(E(λ) ξ, ξ), but the handwritten part is uncertain. It could be a measure φ of E(λ)ξ. I want to be cautious and avoid hallucinating details, focusing on what’s visible. The first word is definitely "Wenn," and the upper limit for the integral is "∞." The lower limit is suggested to be -∞.
**Transcribing and styling the math expression**

I see the expression “∫ λ^2 dφ(E(λ) ξ,” and there’s possibly a closing parenthesis. It seems like the last symbol might be the Greek letter “ξ.” I can create HTML that displays this line with an italic handwriting style. The user wants it to look pretty, so I’ll use a cursive font and adjust letter spacing. I’ll keep the line breaks as visible in the image and ensure I use MathJax for the math expression, ignoring any partially cut off text in the background. We'll only include "Wenn" and the math part.
**Creating HTML for math expression**

I’m going to present a centered line with "Wenn," followed by appropriate spacing, and then the integral formula. The integration variable is a bit ambiguous, so I’ll write it as \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \lambda^2 \, d\varphi(E(\lambda)\,\xi). I need to use \varphi for φ and ξ for xi, which works well! I’ll focus on outputting only the HTML code with the MathJax script included for rendering mathematical expressions. I'll make sure to keep the formatting close to the original, left-aligning "Wenn" with adequate spacing in between.
**Crafting the HTML structure**

I'm deciding to display "Wenn" inline with the math expression and apply a cursive style to both. I'll create an HTML skeleton that includes necessary elements, such as the MathJax script for rendering math. 

I notice in the image there’s an upper limit "∞" near the integral sign, which is a bit unclear, but we'll go with \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}. I’m also keeping the spacing consistent in one line while ensuring everything looks italicized. Now I’ll just output the clean HTML code without any extra elements.
