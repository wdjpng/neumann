**Transcribing the letter**

I need to transcribe all the visible text from a handwritten German letter snippet while preserving the formatting and line breaks. It looks like there won’t be any mathematical expressions to convert with MathJax. I should also ignore any lines that are partially cut off. The signature seems to be from "J. v. Neumann," which is consistent with 'v.' standing for von. The line "Verbleibe ich Ihr ganz ergebener" appears complete despite some cuts above it.
**Checking edges for transcription**

First, I need to ignore any superimposed text from the reverse side of the snippet. The visible line "Verbleibe ich Ihr ganz ergebener" is fully captured, along with the signature "J. v. Neumann." The 'u' has a little arch above it, resembling a diacritic, but that detail isn't crucial. I'll aim to replicate the text in an artful way, possibly using a cursive font for a handwritten effect. Next, I see a postscript "P.S." and the following lines that seem to hyphenate "Besuch" across a line break, continuing with "such meiner Eltern — hier in Karlsbad."
**Considering formatting for transcription**

I need to ensure I preserve hyphenation and line breaks just like in the image. The first line says "P.S." followed by "Ich bin nur kurze Zeit — zum Be-" with "such meiner Eltern — hier in Karlsbad" on the next line. I should ignore any faint background text above this. The signature below reads "J. v. Neumann," and I think the 'v.' should be a small 'v.' I'll output only the HTML code, focusing on making it look nice while maintaining the format with `<div>` for cursive font and `<span>` for long dashes.
**Constructing the letter layout**

I want to use &mdash; for proper letter-like styling and create a container `<div class="letter">`. The font family will be 'Georgia, "Times New Roman" for the classic look, but to emulate handwriting, I’ll go with 'Segoe Script', 'Lucida Handwriting', and 'Brush Script MT'—cursive might be too generic. I’m aiming for a color of #174a8e to mimic blue ink against a background of #f6f1df that reflects a yellowish hue.

I’ll present the lines as they originally appear, starting with "Verbleibe ich Ihr ganz ergebener," followed by "J. v. Neumann," which I’m thinking could be centered. After that, I’ll include spacing and then the "P.S." lines, making sure to style "— zum Be-" with the appropriate em dash and hyphen at the end.
**Finalizing the transcription**

I’ll keep everything as given and use `<br>` to preserve line breaks. For the signature, I might use `<i>` for some italicization, but the entire container will remain in a cursive font to mimic handwriting. I’ll ignore any faint background text and won’t need MathJax since there are no mathematical expressions to render.

Since there are no partially cut off lines, I’ll craft the HTML snippet, ensuring it includes minimal styling within a `<style>` tag. I plan to format the output to give it a nice look with appropriate margins and a background that resembles paper. 

The transcribed text includes:

"Verbleibe ich Ihr ganz ergebener"  
"J. v. Neumann."  
"P.S."  
"Ich bin nur kurze Zeit — zum Be-"  
"such meiner Eltern — hier in Karlsbad."  

I'll include the necessary spacing, using &mdash; for the em dash and adding a trailing period after "Karlsbad." I'll make sure "P.S." is centered on its line. Time to finalize the HTML!
