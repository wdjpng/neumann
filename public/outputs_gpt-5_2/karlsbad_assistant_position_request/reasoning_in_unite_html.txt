**Unifying background styles**

I see that some fragments mention "Der Satz ist... schwer" twice across two files, so I need to keep just one instance. I must also set the body background to a solid color rather than a gradient or multiple colors. A suggestion is to use #f6f2e6, which was in the first header. It's crucial to maintain a consistent look, so I'll unify the background on the entire page and keep the header style similar for cohesiveness.
**Creating the letter layout**

I'm planning to set up a container for the letter, including the letterhead, date, salutation, and main paragraphs in a consistent "body-text" style, likely using Georgia. The directive emphasizes a unified formatting, so I'll make the body text cohesive, possibly with normal font size in paragraphs. MathJax will be included for typesetting equations, and I'll ensure we have a single script linked centrally. Additionally, I'll fix typos carefully and unify line breaks without altering the overall content.
**Standardizing letter formatting**

I see the instruction is to create a single consistent formatting for the main body of the letter and address hyphenated words. We should avoid changing any words while possibly adjusting hyphenation across line breaks. I can preserve hyphenated words as seen in the transcript, like "Assisten- tenstelle," but need to be cautious about altering the content. It seems best to keep the original text as much as possible while combining line breaks into proper paragraphs. Duplicates should be removed, and the postscript needs to be maintained as well.
**Gathering letter content**

I need to organize the content of the letter in the usual format. First, I'll include the header with the hotel’s letterhead and the date from the first file, keeping it unchanged. The salutation will be “Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!” Next, I'll start the main body with, "Ich wende mich mit einer Bitte an Sie, in der Hoffnung Ihnen dadurch keine wesentliche Mühe zu verursachen," and I'll also gather additional fragments from the second file. I'll ensure everything flows seamlessly together.
**Finalizing letter content**

I need to compile the final letter, starting with the header that includes the hotel's letterhead and the date from the first file. The salutation will be "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" For the body, I will combine and organize the paragraphs while maintaining the original content as stated, including specific phrases and avoiding duplicates. I'll keep the formatting consistent, using CSS for a unicolor background and unified typography. MathJax will be integrated for any mathematical notation. I'll ensure everything flows well and retains clarity.
**Compiling letter content**

I'm working on compiling the letter. I'll continue from "Ich hoffe daher annehmen zu können," ensuring the appropriate flow and structure. I plan to keep the mathematical notations and phrases consistent while joining incomplete segments. There’s some duplication I need to address, especially with "nition des Eigenwertproblems," which we can drop as it's a shortened version of "Definition." I'll also manage the formatting for paragraphs and ensure everything is unified, including CSS for a solid background and consistent font styles. Finally, I’ll ensure the letter is cohesive and clear.
**Organizing letter content**

I’m working on the letter regarding the assistant position at the University of Berlin. It’s important to keep the original hyphenations as they’re part of the content. I want to merge lines into cohesive paragraphs while preserving the necessary formatting. The text includes some errors, like "hjabe" instead of "habe," but I won't change them since they are part of the original. The goal is to present it well, with underlined terms intact, while ensuring readability and clarity. I'll compile everything into a formatted letter.
**Formatting mathematical content**

I'm working on finalizing the mathematical paragraphs in the document. I need to ensure proper formatting for equations, especially when it comes to LaTeX for expressions like the integral I've referenced. Each paragraph should be distinct to maintain clarity, so I'll split them accordingly and preserve the original wording, including any hyphenations. As I implement the CSS, I’ll unify styles, keeping the original header and margin notes intact while ensuring consistency across the body text. Time to wrap this up!
