  "summary": "Von Neumann presents a mathematical example involving critical formulas and a correction procedure, demonstrating that the number of steps required depends on the numerical value of the substituent. He concludes that this negatively answers whether a uniform length estimate for the correction procedure is possible independent of the size of number substituents, leaving the proof of finite termination incomplete for degree 3.",
