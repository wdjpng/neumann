  "summary": "Von Neumann presents a mathematical example demonstrating that the length of a correction procedure in a modified Ackermann proof depends on the numerical value of substituents, not just the form of critical formulas. He concludes that this reveals an incompleteness in the proof of finite termination for the procedure at degree 3.",
