**Analyzing bounding box requirements**

I’m trying to figure out how to output bounding boxes for chunks with top-left and bottom-right coordinates. The goal is to cover groups of lines, with a limit of 2-4 lines of mathematical expressions per chunk. The document is a handwritten letter in German that includes many math formulas among the text, so it's important to use the full width of each letter page while ensuring no more than eight lines of text per chunk. The key focus is on the equation limit, and I must avoid splitting any lines across boxes, even if some are slanted. I also need to confirm the image resolution, which seems to be 969x768, but I'm double-checking that it really is in portrait orientation.
**Defining resolution and chunking strategy**

It looks like the document's resolution is 969x768 pixels, giving a width of 768 and height of 969. Since it's a vertical letter page, I need to output coordinates in the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format for each chunk. I'll consider a small left margin, maybe 20 pixels, making x1 potentially 20 and x2 748. I can include the entire width, even with margins. I'll start chunking from the top, noting that the header lines aren't math, but I could include them in the first chunk along with the salutation.
**Structuring text chunks**

The next section begins with "Lieber Herr Professor Bernays!" followed by "Das mir interessierende Beispiel sieht so aus: Voraussetzungen:" and then mathematical lines. It seems there are bullet points with formulas like "U1(x,y) ≡ (x=0) → (x=y)?" and about six lines of math under "Voraussetzungen:". It continues with "Kritische Formeln:" and some more enumerated math lines. There’s also some prose with lettered sections A., B., C., D., mixing paragraphs with math expressions. Since I need to keep it to 3-4 lines of equations per chunk, I think for Chunk 1, I’ll include the header, salutation, and lines up to before "Voraussetzungen," but I might include "Voraussetzungen:" to provide context before the formulas start.
**Planning chunk divisions**

I need to include the header and the opening sentence before the formulas, which is great. For Chunk 2, I'll focus on the "Voraussetzungen:" section, which has around 6 or 7 math lines. I need to keep it to 3-4 math lines per chunk, so I can split this into two parts. I can estimate where these lines fall vertically and provide approximate integer coordinates. To use near-full width, I’ll set x1 at 0 and x2 at 767 to ensure I cover the whole page width while staying within the appropriate edges. The height is 969, so y2 can go up to 968.
**Estimating y coordinates and chunk boundaries**

I need to approximate the vertical positions of different lines on the page. The header lines seem to fall around y 20-60. Each line must be fully contained, so I'll allow for some overlaps between chunks—20 to 30 pixels sounds good. For example, I can set Chunk 1 to capture the header and salutation until right before the math lines, ideally y 0-250. Chunk 2 can focus on the first portion of the "Voraussetzungen:" math lines around y 230-380, while Chunk 3 captures the rest, ensuring not to exceed 3-4 math lines. The following chunks will continue this pattern, defining approximate y values and preventing too many equations per chunk. I’ll keep the whole structure to under ten chunks, and I'm planning for some overlaps to handle any tricky placements while keeping the math lines in check.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I need to make sure each chunk has the right boundaries, particularly for the math lines. I'll have Ch2 and Ch3 include 3-4 lines each, ensuring the split is safe without exceeding the total of 10 chunks allowed. We can create smaller chunks for the "Voraussetzungen" math lines for accuracy while keeping the whole width. The y values are crucial, and my final chunks will be: 

1) (0, 0, 767, 250)  
2) (0, 240, 767, 310)  
3) (0, 300, 767, 380)  
4) (0, 370, 767, 470)  
5) (0, 460, 767, 640)  
6) (0, 630, 767, 730)  
7) (0, 720, 767, 810)  
8) (0, 800, 767, 885)  
9) (0, 875, 767, 940)  
10) (0, 930, 767, 968)  

The total resolution is (768, 969), ensuring every line is fully contained. I think I’m on the right track!
