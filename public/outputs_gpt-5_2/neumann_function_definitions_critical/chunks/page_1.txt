**Defining image chunking**

I'm figuring out how to split the image into 2-10 rectangular chunks, keeping in mind the constraint of containing only 2-4 lines of math expressions per chunk — unless it's the only option.

The image is a handwritten letter, so I'll need to output the coordinates for these rectangles. It’s important to include the full width of each letter page when possible. 

Based on the dimensions, I think x1 can be zero, and x2 should be the entire image width, helping avoid slanting lines!
**Segmenting text chunks**

I’m making sure that each chunk of the image contains no more than 8 lines of text and limits equations to 3-4 lines. I’m looking at the image size, 768x969, which has various sections like a header with a date and a greeting.

Next, there are definitions with symbols and math. I should categorize the content into parts, including headers, greetings, definitions, and text, while keeping the chunks manageable. I'll keep track of the lists and formulas, ensuring none exceed my established line limits!
**Determining rectangle boundaries**

I need to split the image into 7-8 rectangles, making sure to include the full width from 0 to 768. Each chunk must fully contain every line of text or math, even if it means allowing some overlap between chunks where lines don’t align straight.

Starting with the image height of 969, I’m estimating the y-coordinates for row separators. The header occupies roughly the first 140 pixels and might include the two header lines at y 25, and then the greeting and intro lines would be found around y 150-240.
**Chunking equations and text**

Next, I’m identifying the lines starting from "Bezeichnungen:" around y 240, which extend to about y 450. There are several short lines with symbols, and I’ll need to split these into 2-3 chunks to keep math lines to 3-4 per chunk.

Following that, there’s "Kritische Formeln:" with two formulas and a text line about ranks. I’ll keep this as a separate chunk because it also contains equation lines. Finally, the paragraph under part A contains mostly text but includes a few equations. I want to ensure that I limit each chunk to 3-4 lines of equations, focusing on primarily math lines.
**Finalizing rectangle segmentation**

I'm organizing the text into chunks, starting with B., which is about 10 lines, and likely needs to be split into two parts to keep under the eight-line maximum. For the y-coordinates, the image has a height of 969 pixels. 

From there, I’ll split the sections accordingly, being careful with pixel boundaries to ensure no line is cut off while allowing overlaps. I’m considering combining some chunks to keep the count under 10, particularly with the header and greeting. I think I can merge chunk1 and chunk2, reducing the total to 9 rectangles – that seems acceptable!
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I need to make sure my chunks stay under eight lines of text, which means combining some like the header and greeting into a single chunk. I’ve restructured the chunks accordingly, ensuring overlaps of 10-20 pixels to fully include lines—especially important since some are slanted.

Now, I’m finalizing the coordinate output per chunk, making sure to keep the entire width of the image. I’m also adjusting the boundaries to ensure proper inclusion, settling on 767 for the x2 and 968 for the y2 coordinates, keeping things safe and accurate!
