**Transcribing handwritten math**

I need to transcribe text into HTML from a snippet of handwritten math scribbles. I should ignore any lines that are partially cut off. The left edge is cut off, so only fully visible lines need to be included. The top line has "≡ 0? y, k, Eu L(y+1,u))," but it’s tough to read. The second line shows "≡ L ( e y L(y), v)." I should be cautious since the text looks ambiguous. I’ll also use MathJax for rendering.
**Clarifying transcription guidelines**

I need to ignore any partially cut lines. In this crop, both lines appear partially cut since the left edges are cropped. The instruction states to completely ignore lines not fully visible from start to end. While both lines are horizontally visible, the leftmost characters may be cut off. It’s a bit ambiguous since the left side shows a bracket and possibly some characters. I need to stick to the guideline and ensure I completely ignore those lines that are not fully intact.
**Transcribing visible lines**

The first line seems fully visible starting with "≡," but there were words also earlier that are cropped out. The top line shows equal sign alignment across the content, and I can see "≡" clearly near the center. However, the instruction says to ignore lines that are partially cut off, so I need to consider if this line is complete. I think both lines might be fully visible, even if it's challenging to read the scribbles. I’ll give transcription a try!
**Reconstructing mathematical lines**

I’m trying to reconstruct two definitions from the handwritten notes. The first line looks like "≡ V(y, k, Eu L(y+1, u))," and the second appears to be "≡ L(e_y L(y), v)." Between the symbols, it seems there’s potential for confusion with characters like "U" and "Eu," which might mean "E_u." The handwriting is challenging. Given my low confidence, I might need to consider omitting lines that are partially cut off. However, if everything is partially cut, should I output empty HTML? I guess a minimal wrapper will do.
**Crafting HTML for math transcription**

I need to transcribe all the text in the image, but leaving it blank isn’t an option. I’ll minimize risk by including math expressions I’m confident about. Both lines start with "≡." I have to be careful with placeholders. Maybe I can use MathJax to render the equations while including only minimal elements. My goal is to create HTML that closely follows the original formatting. 

I’ll include two lines and add the MathJax script with basic CSS for styling. Let’s get that final output ready!
