**Designing an HTML page**

I’m thinking about creating an HTML page where there’s plenty of whitespace, and I’ll align the signature to the right. I need to use MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions, but I should ignore any lines that are partially cut off. For example, there's likely a "Yours" above the signature line, but it’s cut off. I want to make it visually appealing with a serif font and a nice layout for the signature. I'll ensure I only output the HTML code without any extra formatting.
**Creating minimal HTML structure**

I’m considering including the MathJax script, but it’s not essential. Let’s focus on crafting a minimal HTML layout. I’ll start by setting the charset and title, and then create a body with a lightened background color and a container around 900px wide to simulate paper. I’ll add margins and spacing, placing the signature block aligned right. The signature "J. v. Neumann." will be in a large cursive italic font, with a swoosh mark above "Neumann" to replicate its curvature. I'll use Unicode for that, if needed.
**Finalizing the HTML layout**

I’ll align the signature with a margin-top of 20px and keep a minimal design, including a wrapper mimicking letter paper style. My structure will look like this: a simple HTML document with a DOCTYPE declaration, a head for CSS styles, and a body containing a `<div>` for the page and another `<div>` for the signature "J. v. Neumann."  

I’ll make sure to provide space below to reflect the bottom of the page while excluding any partially cut-off text from the screenshot. MathJax isn't necessary, so I’ll focus on implementing a tan paper background with a gradient.
