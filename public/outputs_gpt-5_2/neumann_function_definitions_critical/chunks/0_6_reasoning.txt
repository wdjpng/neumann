**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe text from an image to HTML while keeping the formatting and line breaks intact. The image is a narrow strip of handwritten text with math and letters, but I should ignore any partially cut-off lines. I see something that might say "B. z." which could refer to the German abbreviation for "beziehungsweise." There's also a math fragment—"g(y+1, u)" and later a statement that looks like “für z = k jedenfalls wahr,” meaning “true for z = k in any case.” Let's inspect it closely segment by segment!
**Analyzing handwritten math text**

In the leftmost corner, I see "B." underlined, which might label case B. Next, I notice "g. ? 1, 5, 6," possibly indicating a set of values for z like "z ∈ {1, 5, 6}." I should take it step-by-step: it looks like "g(y+1,u)," which suggests a German mathematical expression. The clear part says "für z = k jedenfalls wahr," meaning "true for z = k in any case.” I think the previous part is "ist," leading to a full line that could be "B. g(y+1,u) ist für z = k jedenfalls wahr." Let’s confirm those connections!
**Transcribing text accurately**

The earlier segment "B. z 4,1,5,6" might not be what I thought. The instructions are clear: I need to fully transcribe all text in the image, keeping the formatting intact, and using MathJax for mathematical expressions. However, there's a risk of incorrect transcription. It seems like there's only one fully visible line, even though the edges might be cut. I should preserve this as a styled snippet in a `<div>`. I’ll use MathJax for expressions like \( z = k \) and include the visible parts accurately.
**Interpreting the left text segment**

I see something like "B. z u, 1, 5, 6, 6(?), G(y+1, u))", but it feels too uncertain. It might be "z 1, 5, 6, 6 4 9? G(y+1, u))". I think I should focus on sections I'm confident about, like "ist für z = k jedenfalls wahr." The instructions require a full transcription, but if needed, I could use brackets for unclear parts like [illegible], although they didn’t mention annotating. It might be better to represent ambiguous scribbles as shapes, but OCR was requested. I’ll refine my observations from the left cluster again, noting variations like "B. z 4, 1, 5, 6, 6(4?9?)?" or "G(y+1, u)" that may also be "g".
**Formulating the HTML transcription**

The segment looks like it includes "B." followed by a function "G(y+1,u)" and it definitely states, "ist für z = k jedenfalls wahr," meaning "true for z = k in any case." There are uncertainties in the scribbles before this, so I should focus on the clear parts. I’ll encode it as: 

"B. … G(y+1, u)) ist für z = k jedenfalls wahr."

I can use a long em dash for omitted content and will include MathJax for parts like \(G(y+1,u)\) and \(z = k\). I’ll create a styled HTML snippet to mimic handwriting, using appropriate CSS for that handwritten look. Let’s finalize this into a neat format!
