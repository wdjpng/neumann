**Transcribing German handwriting**

I need to transcribe all the text from the image into HTML, making sure to keep line breaks intact and ignore any lines that are partially cut off. The handwriting is in German, and I’ll need to use MathJax for any formulas mentioned, like the one with "l = 0." I see that the first complete line starts with "Bei jedem weiteren Schritt-Paar wird l um 1 ver-." I must double-check my reading, especially because there's a hyphen at the end.
**Continuing transcription of the text**

The text seems to read: "Bei jedem weiteren Schritt-Paar wird l um 1 vermindigt, bis es nicht 0 geworden ist; bei l=0 ist der zweite Schritt bereits gegenstandslos. Daher werden insgesamt 2k+1 Schritte notwendig sein." That seems plausible. 

I noticed a mistake with "nicht 0"—it might be better as "null." So the lines I'm deciphering look like this: 

1. "Bei jedem weiteren Schritt-Paar wird l um 1 ver-"
2. "mindigt, bis es 0 geworden ist; bei l=0"
3. "ist der zweite Schritt bereits gegenstandslos. Da-"
4. "her werden insgesamt 2k+1 Schritte notwen-"
5. "dig sein... And a signature follows. 

I need to be precise!
**Examining the visible text**

After the blank line, I see "E." at the left margin followed by "Somit hängt die Zahl der erforderlichen Schritt-." I need to focus on what's fully visible. Although part of this line continues beyond the right edge, it seems the text we have is legible. 

The line beginning with "E. Somit hängt die Zahl der erforderlichen Schritt-" appears complete, at least until the hyphen. I must remember to only include lines that aren't cut off to maintain accuracy in transcription.
**Transcribing and formatting text**

Looking carefully, I see at the bottom line: "Somit hängt die Zahl der erforderlichen Schritt-." There are more words after "Schritt-" that likely begin with "... For" or maybe "Fort," but it continues off the right. The line "E. Somit hängt die Zahl der erforderlichen Schritt-" is fully visible, even if the next lines are cropped. I can include this line, but I'll have to ignore the ones below it. 

I want to ensure fidelity in transcription, incorporating the math notation for \(l = 0\) and \(2k + 1\). Additionally, I'll format "l um 1 vermindigt" to include the number \(1\). Those must all be presented clearly!
**Crafting the HTML document**

I need to create an HTML document while preserving line breaks. The aim is to keep it minimal yet appealing. I can add a `<div class="letter">` for styling. The key is to ensure all visible lines are transcribed accurately and incorporate MathJax for math notation like \(l=0\) and \(2k+1\).

I’ll start my HTML structure and maintain fidelity to the handwriting. I should use correct spelling, like "vermindert" instead of "mindigt." Even if "nicht" appears in the text, careful examination reveals how I should transcribe it. Accuracy is essential!
**Finalizing the HTML transcription**

Since I can’t verify everything, I’ll proceed with "vermindigt," as it seems plausible. The third line reads: "ist der zweite Schritt bereits gegenstandslos. Da-," which looks good. The fourth line is: "her werden insgesamt 2k+1 Schritte notwen-," and the fifth is "dig sein." The following line, "E. Somit hängt die Zahl der erforderlichen Schritt-," is also accurate.

I’ll replicate the line breaks using `<br>` or `.line` elements in the HTML structure. Now I just need to add the meta character set and craft the final minimal HTML!
