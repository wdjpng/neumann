**Rethinking transcription accuracy**

I need to be careful about not hallucinating content while transcribing. It's okay to get close, but I must aim for accuracy. I'm noticing this glyph could be an "O" with a tail. There’s also possibility it stands for "Ur" and is followed by "Lo." I’m trying to make sense of the potential logical meaning here, but it’s a bit unclear. I need to keep re-examining the details to avoid assumptions.
**Clarifying logical definitions**

It looks like "Or(x y z)" indeed requires three arguments and is defined as "(z=0) -> (x=y)." I'm reconsidering whether it's "So" or "Lo." The letter looks like it might be "S," but it has a loop that could indicate "L" too. The next line starts with "Lo (x y)" or "So (x y)," leading to a logical equivalence. There's also the phrase "k eine effektive Zahl," but "k" doesn’t seem to fit alone since “keine” means "no," which doesn't align with the context here.
**Interpreting effective numbers**

I'm considering "k eine" in the context of "k eine effektive Zahl ≡ 1,2,3...," which seems to say that 'k' is an effective number like 1, 2, or 3. The word "eine" acts as the indefinite article "a" in German, suggesting it translates to "'k' as an effective number." It feels a bit awkward without "ist," as it could be shorthand. I see that "Zahl" leads to "≡ 1,2,3...," which looks like an affirmation. There are also parentheses around x, y, and z with equals and arrows, which is interesting!
**Replicating with MathJax**

I think we should use MathJax to format the math correctly. Using monospace for the lines will help preserve spacing, and it's good to consider pre blocks for maintaining line breaks. The user requests MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions, so I can embed the math within \( ... \) or display it using $$ ... $$. I notice that the screenshot may have cut off the top and bottom lines, but the visible lines seem complete. I'll just transcribe the three lines, making sure to account for any punctuation, like a comma after the first line.
**Creating HTML with MathJax**

I need to produce only HTML without code fences and include the MathJax script, even though the user hasn't explicitly asked for the link. I'll set up a full HTML document, including a simple header. Since the user wants pretty formatting, I'll style the text while keeping the original format, capturing line breaks and math arrangement. 

I'll use MathJax for rendering. The lines will contain mathematical expressions like \( \mathrm{Or}(x,y,z) \equiv (z=0) \to (x=y) \), and I'll ensure to include everything that's clear while ignoring any partially cut-off lines. Let's get this final HTML structured correctly!
