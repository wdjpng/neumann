**Evaluating transcription guidelines**

It seems the guideline requires ignoring partially cut-off lines, but I need to focus on accurately transcribing all readable text. While it might be tempting to replace unclear parts with placeholders, that wouldn't be faithful to the requirement. They did mention using MathJax, and I could generate handwritten-looking text, but I’m unsure. For the formulas, I'll try to provide readable representations, even if I'm not completely confident about how they look. It’s definitely a challenge!
**Analyzing critical formulas**

I'm considering the possibility that the formula might be "(∃x ∉ ∂ (..))." I’ve also stumbled upon Hilbert's epsilon calculus and its concept of "critical formulas." The critical formulas include A(t) -> A(εx A(x)), and another could be ∃x A(x) -> A(εx A(x)). So, the first formula I see in the image doesn't quite match, but it might be "L(K) → L (∃y L(y)).” The second formula could relate to epsilon operators—though I'm still figuring out the details. It's a bit complex!
**Examining formula shapes**

I'm thinking that the last part could be "ε" shaped loops. The second formula's first character looks like script D, but maybe that’s actually "∃," which can resemble a backward E or a stylized 3 in handwriting. So, I see that shape! The formulas I'm considering are: 1. L(K) → L(∃y L(y)), and 2. ∃L(∃y L(y)) → ∃(εx ε...). Alternatively, maybe the letters are "G" or even "E." Given the confusion, I might want to deliver the formulas just as they are shown, including "Kritische Formeln."
**Planning the formula presentation**

I’m thinking about how to format the mathematical formulas as images, but it seems MathJax is the requirement. Here's my plan: 

- For the title "Kritische Formeln," I’ll underline it with a decorative bottom border. 
- The numbered list will have items "1." and "2." each with a small underline, similar to the image. 
- For the formulas, item 1 looks like "L(K) → L(∃ y L(y))," which will include a trailing comma. 

For item 2, I'm unsure if it should be "∂L(∃y L(y)) → ∂(∃x ∼ ∂(x y))" or "∃L(∃y L(y)) → ∃ (εx ε(yy))." I might need to exclude anything unclear since accuracy is key!
**Finalizing the transcription**

I realize that ignoring any visible text isn’t the right approach—we need to include it. Presenting the text using OCR might be an option, but accuracy is essential! For the second formula, I'm leaning toward "∃L(∃y L(y)) → ∃(εx ε(xx))." I wonder if the letters are script versions. I’ll indicate potential issues with the formulas due to these complexities and keep referencing MathJax for rendering. Overall, I plan to output the header "Kritische Formeln" and the first formula as intended, while marking the second as uncertain. Let's create the HTML for that!
