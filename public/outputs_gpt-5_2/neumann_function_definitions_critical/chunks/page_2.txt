**Planning text chunks**

I'm inspecting a document visually. It starts with a German sentence around y=70, followed by 4-5 lines before a new paragraph begins with "E." at around y=195. I see around 5-6 lines until y=320, then more lines until near the bottom with signature lines at y=780-860. I need to keep each chunk to 8 lines or fewer, so I'll plan 4 chunks: the first chunk can be the top 5-6 lines up to the beginning of the "E." section.
**Segmenting image vertically**

To avoid line splits in the text, I need approximate y-coordinates for segmentation. A simpler approach would be to divide the image into 4 chunks, each around 240 pixels high, with a 10-20 pixel overlap to prevent cutting through lines. With a height of 957 pixels, I’ll set the boundaries as follows: 

Chunk A will go from y1=0 to y2=255, overlapping into Chunk B, which runs from y1=235 to y2=480. Chunk C goes y1=465 to y2=720, and Chunk D from y1=705 to y2=957.
**Coordinating text for chunks**

I want to coordinate with the text distribution to ensure I don't exceed 8 lines per chunk. Since I have 4 chunks across roughly 24 lines, that gives about 6 lines per chunk, which is manageable. To avoid splitting lines, I can use overlaps, making sure every line is fully contained in at least one chunk. Additionally, I should include the full width of each letter page, so I’ll set x1=0 and x2=767, using inclusive coordinates for clarity. Despite the margins, it's safe to use the full width.
**Refining chunk heights**

I'm looking at the text regions in the image to refine the chunk heights. The top text goes from around y=60 to y=340. I can divide this into 4 chunks: 

Chunk 1 will cover y=0 to y=220, likely including about 4 lines. Chunk 2 will be y=200 to y=410 for the next 5-6 lines, including the "E." lines. Chunk 3 spans y=390 to y=660, covering a major paragraph starting with "Ich glaube..." Lastly, Chunk 4 ranges from y=640 to y=957, ensuring I include signature lines. Each chunk has overlaps of 20 pixels; I hope that's alright!
