**Evaluating image chunking**

I need to split the image into chunks containing text lines, but since this is a typed letter with no math, the usual rules still apply. I can include up to eight lines of text per chunk, which is fine. The image is a paper letter with typed body and some handwritten notes at the bottom. I’ll aim to use the full width of each letter page, setting the starting margins to ensure everything fits nicely.
**Breaking down image chunking**

I need to provide pixel coordinates relative to the entire image, so for simplicity, including the full width of the image for each chunk is best. This way, the page width is ensured. I should segment the letter into two to ten chunks, covering the header, recipient address, body paragraphs, closing signature, and handwritten response lines. Each chunk can contain about eight lines, making sure each line is fully within its chunk, even if that means overlapping slightly.
**Structuring letter chunks**

I see that the recipient address will take about 4-5 lines, followed by a salutation like "Dear van der Waerden:" as one line. The body paragraphs could run around 12-14 lines. For the closing, I’ll include lines like "With best personal regards," and the signature "John von Neumann," along with the initials. Plus, there’s a handwritten note at the bottom, which can be 5-8 lines. I think we can split this into about six chunks, ensuring not to exceed eight lines per chunk.
**Defining letter chunks**

For the second body paragraph about visiting Zurich, I anticipate it could take around 12 lines. To keep each chunk under eight lines, I’ll need to split it into two separate chunks. The closing part includes lines like "With best personal regards," and "Cordially yours," along with the typed name and the "JvN:mag" line. The signature is a graphical representation, but I think it counts as a line. I’ll also need to account for the handwritten reply starting with "Dear von Neumann," which may have about 9-10 lines, so I'll plan to split that as well while ensuring a slight overlap for cohesion.
**Refining image coordinates**

The image height is 967 pixels. To structure my chunks effectively, I see the top margin starts from y 0-100, with the header around y 140. I'll need precise coordinates, ensuring full lines are included. For Chunk 1, I'll cover from y 0 to 270, capturing the header and date, and include the entire width from x 0 to 767.

Next, Chunk 2 will cover the recipient's address and salutation, from y 260 to 420. For Chunk 3, I'll handle the first paragraph, about y 410-545. I'll split Chunk 4 for the second paragraph on Zurich, and clearly designate the subsequent chunks, ensuring overlaps are generous. Finally, I'll confirm the total resolution of the image is (768, 967).
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I need to ensure that all lines are entirely contained in the appropriate chunks. I’ve adjusted Chunk 1 to extend to y 310 to include the date line, then we’ll set Chunk 2 from y 240 to 430. It's important to overlap these chunks sufficiently to avoid splitting lines. 

After refining the subsequent chunks, I have:

(0, 0, 767, 310)  
(0, 240, 767, 430)  
(0, 410, 767, 560)  
(0, 540, 767, 660)  
(0, 650, 767, 770)  
(0, 760, 767, 890)  
(0, 880, 767, 950)  
(0, 940, 767, 966)  
(768, 967)  

Everything looks good, and now it's ready to deliver!
