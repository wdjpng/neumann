**Transcribing image text**

I need to transcribe all visible text from the image while ignoring any partially cut off lines. I’ll use an HTML structure to replicate its formatting, aiming for a monospaced typewriter style with proper indentation and line breaks. 

There’s a header I need to check for spelling, like “Mathematisches Institut der Universität Zürich Zürich, Switzerland.” I’ll ensure to add the MathJax script for future math expressions, even if none are present now. The body should be laid out neatly in monospaced text.
**Transcribing visible text**

I'm transcribing the text provided in the image while acknowledging some cut-off lines. The bottom of the second paragraph ends with "give a talk at this time, if this is agreeable to you," and I think that's complete. The third paragraph likely continues below but is cut off. 

I’ll be sure to transcribe everything accurately, including punctuation and spacing. The first lines are: 

Professor B. L. van der Waerden  
Mathematisches Institut  
der Universität Zürich  
Zürich, Switzerland  

After some space, there's "Dear van der Waerden:" which is preceded by "Dear" with a capital D.
**Transcribing paragraphs accurately**

The text continues with, "Please excuse my delay in answering your very kind invitation of July 13—I have been traveling a good deal and was in Mexico during most of the last five weeks." It looks like the first paragraph has an indentation of 4 or 5 spaces, starting just below "Dear van der Waerden:". 

I’ll replicate the indentation using non-breaking spaces. The second paragraph begins with, "I would like to visit Zürich during my European trip next summer, but I am afraid that I won't be able to come there after the Congress."
**Confirming text accuracy**

The text elaborates, "I do expect to come to Zürich shortly before the Congress—but I am afraid that this may not be a very good time for seeing you or the other colleagues there or to give a talk, since this is likely to be your vacation period." 

I'll check specifics like the use of dashes, ensure "July 13--I have been" has a double hyphen, and confirm that "won't" has a curly apostrophe. I’ll incorporate the umlaut in "Zürich" and format everything using HTML with the correct fonts, like "Courier," for a typewriter feel.
**Crafting HTML layout**

I need to format the letter in a monospaced style, aligning everything to the left, with a container width of around 700 pixels. I'll use `<pre>` to preserve spacing and line breaks exactly.

The header should look professional but not overly elaborate. I must also ignore lines partially cut off and be careful with details like the salutation "Dear van der Waerden:" which uses "van der" in lowercase. 

I’ll ensure the document is a complete HTML file, including the MathJax script for potential math expressions, even if there aren't any.
**Finalizing HTML layout**

I’m finalizing the letter format, expecting to come to Zürich shortly before the Congress. I want to ensure the letter maintains a typewriter style, preserving any double spaces after periods as seen in the image.

I'll style the body with a light background color, resembling paper. The header will be simply left-aligned. Lines partially cut off will be completely ignored. Overall, I’ll include the proper encoding for umlauts and set a typewriter font like "Courier." 

Finally, I’ll wrap the content in a `<div class="letter">` with a `<pre>` block for proper formatting.
