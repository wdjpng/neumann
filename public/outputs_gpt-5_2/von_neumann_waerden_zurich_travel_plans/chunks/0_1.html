Professor B. L. van der Waerden
Mathematisches Institut
der Universität Zürich
Zürich, Switzerland

Dear van der Waerden:

     Please excuse my delay in answering your very kind
invitation of July 13--I have been travelling a good deal
and was in Mexico during most of the last five weeks.

     I would like to visit Zürich during my European
trip next summer, but I am afraid that I won't be able
to come there after the Congress.  I expect that I will
have to return then more or less directly (with at most
a short stopover in England) to Princeton.  I do expect
to come to Zürich shortly before the Congress--but I am
afraid that this may not be a very good time for seeing
you or the other colleagues there or to give a talk, since
this is likely to be your vacation period.  Am I correct
in this?  If this is not the case, I would be more than
delighted to stop in Zürich before the Congress and give
a talk at this time, if this is agreeable to you.
