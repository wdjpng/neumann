**Clarifying a phrase**

I'm reviewing the text and noting that the second line begins with "wird lasse ich fort," while the first line ends with "gewonnen." So I think the phrase might be, "Beweis dafür, daß wirklich die erste kritische e-Zahl gewonnen wird, lasse ich fort..." 

I'm unsure about "E-Zahl." It could refer to "Eigenzahl," and perhaps "e-Zahl" is shorthand for it? The handwriting shows "e-Zahl" hyphenated, so it might be "Kritische E-Zahl." The letters after "kritische" look like "e-Zahl," but it's tricky to tell.
**Creating HTML formatting**

I’m focusing on producing HTML that replicates the formatting of a letter. I need to keep the line breaks and avoid any lines that are cut off from the screenshot. The screenshot shows three complete lines, and there aren’t any truncated lines at the top or bottom, so I’ll just transcribe those visible lines. 

To make it visually appealing, I could use a typewriter or cursive style. The request is to “make it pretty,” so I think wrapping it in a container with a paper-like background would work. I'll apply CSS for cursive font and spacing, but no external resources are allowed. Although they mentioned MathJax for math expressions, they don't seem necessary here.
**Producing HTML layout**

I'm going to create HTML that mimics a letter. First, I’ll set up a centered container with a "letter" style, using a background color like #f9f5ef, but maybe a parchment style would be prettier. 

I want to ensure I replicate the line breaks accurately, using a `<div class="letter"><div class="lines">` structure with `<br>` tags. While `<pre>` would preserve line breaks, I’m considering using `<p>` for each line to stay closer to the original format. 

For the content, I’ll begin with the line: "Beweis dafür, daß wirklich die erste kritische e‑Zahl gewonnen." I might need to decide on using a non-breaking hyphen for "e‑Zahl."
**Creating line content**

I'm working on Line 2, which reads: "wird, lasse ich fort; es ist am Papier etwas lang und inhaltlich doch." The image shows a comma after "fort," so I think it’s best to stick with that: "wird, lasse ich fort, es ist am Papier etwas lang und inhaltlich doch." 

It seems there’s no comma after "wird" in the handwritten text, but I’ll include it based on grammatical rules. 

Moving on to Line 3: "nicht schwer. Übrigens ist sie hier nicht als Limes der Folge." I need to make sure to include the long "s" in "Übrigens" with the umlaut. Now I’ll return only the HTML code, including a simple style for the background.
**Finalizing HTML styling**

I'm finalizing the HTML for the letter format. It should have a maximum width of 1100px, centered with margins and padding, and feature a background color of #faf6f0 with appropriate text color. I want to create a pleasant and legible design with a shadow effect and appropriate font styles. 

I’m considering adding subtle ruled lines to simulate paper, but I want to avoid going overboard. I’ll include the MathJax script tag even though there aren’t any formulas, and I'll ensure we only have the three complete lines from the screenshot. Now, it’s time to write the final HTML.
