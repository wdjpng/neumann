**Processing image chunks**

I need to split the image into rectangle chunks, limiting math expressions to 2-4 lines per chunk. The document is a handwritten German letter with math expressions, including braces and f( , α). First, I’ll confirm the coordinates for the chunks, then provide the final resolution based on the dimensions I’ve parsed. The resolution appears to be 768 width and 957 height. I plan to create several horizontal chunks across the full width to capture each section effectively.
**Organizing math expressions**

I need to ensure that the math expressions are chunked into sections with at most 3-4 lines of equations. The document starts with "Zürich, den 5 II 1926," followed by greetings and paragraph text. There’s a section with about five lines of equations that must be split appropriately without separating a large expression. Since some lines may include curly braces, I’ll be careful to avoid unintentionally splitting those multi-line expressions while still keeping the chunks manageable and organized.
**Examining expression splitting**

I need to be careful not to split a mathematical expression that spans multiple lines, especially since the guidelines say to avoid it if possible. If an expression is bracketed, cutting across that could lead to issues. However, I might still group the entire set of math lines as one chunk while keeping it within the 2-4 line limit. If the brace is considered one big expression, it could still count as an exception for inclusion even if it exceeds four lines. I'll need to examine this further based on the content following the initial text.
**Establishing chunk boundaries**

I’m looking at the math expressions, like { f(0, α) and f(B1+α, α), which seem to span 4-5 lines within the braces. I’ll set chunk boundaries to encapsulate the whole math block while separating the text above and below. I need to ensure that the lines aren’t straight and allow for overlap, keeping the full width of each letter page. I’ll calculate the coordinates, considering margins, and include overlaps of about 10-15 pixels to avoid straddling boundaries. Estimating y positions will help in this process.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I'm working on setting the chunk coordinates for the document. With a height of 957, I’ve established initial boundaries for different sections, like headers and text blocks. I'll create five chunks: the header from y=0 to 150, the first text from 130 to 360, the math block from 340 to 610, followed by explanatory lines and closing text. To avoid cutting lines, I’ll include some overlap of about 20-40 pixels, ensuring each line is fully contained in its respective chunk. Finally, I’ll make sure the resolution is correct at (768, 957).
**Adjusting chunk parameters**

I’m thinking about the math block's height, aiming to extend it to y=640 to be safe, and adjusting chunk boundaries accordingly. With these updates, I’ll set chunk 3 to end at 640 and chunk 4 to start at 620, ensuring about a 20-pixel overlap. The proposed boundaries are as follows: 

1) (0, 0, 767, 150)  
2) (0, 130, 767, 360)  
3) (0, 340, 767, 640)  
4) (0, 620, 767, 800)  
5) (0, 780, 767, 956)

This arrangement will include the entire width of the letter page, and I’ll finalize these five lines plus the resolution.
