**Preparing HTML format**

I’m figuring out how to keep the formatting similar to the original. It seems I should create a simple HTML structure with some equal spacing. Using italics to mimic handwriting might work! They mentioned replicating the header, but it’s not present in the image, so I’ll focus on the main content. I’ll include commas and vertical bars as separators between terms like ‘ω, ε_ω, ε_{ε_ω}, ε_{ε_{ε_ω}}, …’ to match what I see. Plus, I should load MathJax for rendering.
**Constructing MathJax expressions**

The task involves using MathJax to render mathematical expressions, so I'll include the necessary MathJax script link. The expression line will look like this:

<span class="math">\( \omega, \; \varepsilon_{\omega} \; |\; \varepsilon_{\varepsilon_{\omega}} \; |\; \varepsilon_{\varepsilon_{\varepsilon_{\omega}}} \; , \ldots \)</span>.

I need to ensure I keep the correct punctuation and vertical bars as separators in the sequence. Reconstructing from left to right: it starts with "ω," then space, followed by "εω," a vertical bar, space, "εεω," and then continues similarly until the series of dots. So the final would be: "ω, ε_ω | ε_{ε_ω} | ε_{ε_{ε_ω}} | ...".
**Producing styled HTML**

I’m going to create a styled HTML document in monospace, keeping everything on a single line. A subtle rule line isn't necessary, so I’ll just focus on the HTML itself. Here’s what I’ll include:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Transcription</title>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" async></script>
<style>
body { font-family: "Times New Roman", Georgia, serif; background:#f7f3e9; color:#333; padding: 24px; }
.line { white-space: pre; font-size: 1.35rem; }
.math { }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="line">
  <span class="math">\( \omega, \; \varepsilon_{\omega} \;|\; \varepsilon_{\varepsilon_{\omega}} \;|\; \varepsilon_{\varepsilon_{\varepsilon_{\omega}}} \;|\; \ldots \)</span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

I just want to ensure I use the Greek letter epsilon correctly. I'll output only the HTML.
