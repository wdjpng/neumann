**Transcribing mathematical notes**

I need to transcribe the text from a handwritten German mathematical document into HTML while keeping the formatting and line breaks intact. I see a notation that looks like "f(0, α) = ω^α," which seems accurate. Then there’s this line about "f(β+1, α)" discussing a critical function of "f(β, ξ)." The handwriting seems to clarify it as the critical point defined in terms of "ξ." I’ll need to detail these observations carefully as I parse through the notes.
**Transcribing additional notes**

Next, I’m looking at lines that are scribbled out and partially cut off, but some parts seem visible, like "lim_{n→∞} f(β_n, α)." Even though they’re crossed out, I can keep their formatting, possibly using <s> or <del> in HTML. The last discernible line appears to be "f(lim β_n, α) = lim_{n→∞} f(β_n, α)," which seems to be a general definition for limit ordinal continuity. The earlier line may reference the limit as well. I’ll read through everything carefully to ensure accuracy.
**Reading the critical function notes**

The line reads: "f(β+1, α) = kritische Funktion von f(β, ξ)," with "kritische" suggesting a critical function definition. It looks like it could describe the α-th critical point related to the function f(β, ξ). The scribbled line near the end might reference "lim_{n→∞}". I also note some definitions in the Veblen hierarchy, like φ(0, α) = ω^α and φ(λ, α) relating to limits. Lastly, I'm considering a note: "f(lim β, α) = lim_{β→lim β} f(β, α)" — something to clarify in German.
**Clarifying transcription details**

It looks like the notes might denote an increasing sequence with "β_n." I’m interpreting the line as "f(lim β_n, α) = lim_{n→∞} f(β_n, α)." Upon closer inspection, it seems there’s a strikethrough over "lim_{n→∞}." The clearer line at the bottom confirms: "f(lim β_n, α) = lim_{n→∞} f(β_n, α)." I need to make sure to transcribe accurately while noting any uncertain words. I’ll watch for any lines that are partially cut off, especially at the top.
**Formatting mathematical notes**

I need to transcribe everything while using MathJax for the math expressions by wrapping formulas in \( ... \). I’m considering how to replicate a notebook style, maybe with a subtle paper background and appropriate fonts. There seem to be crossed-out sections that I'll represent with <del> tags. 

For the line "f(lim β_n, α) = lim_{n→∞} f(β_n, α)," I'll include that clearly. Since some lines are difficult to read, I might mark them as illegible with [unleserlich] or similar. I’ll craft the HTML, ensuring accuracy and maintaining the look!
**Crafting HTML for mathematical notes**

I’m thinking about how to handle lines that are crossed out. It might be reasonable to omit heavily scribbled lines if they're unreadable, but I’ll still include any readable portions. For clarity, I’ll mark any unclear lines with an empty <del> tag, like this: <del>[durchgestrichene, unleserliche Zeile]</del>.

The last legible line reads "f(lim β_n, α) = lim_{n→∞} f(β_n, α)," which I’ll format properly in HTML. I plan to use CSS for aesthetics, ensuring it has a parchment-like appearance with lined background. Let's finalize the HTML structure!
