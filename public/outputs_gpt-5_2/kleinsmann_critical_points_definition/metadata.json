  "summary": "Von Neumann discusses his progress on defining large ordinal numbers of the second number class, particularly critical epsilon-numbers, using a method that requires types up to the omega-squared-th level. He presents a recursive function definition and asks Bernays about recent developments in proof theory, including Ackermann's consistency proof.",
