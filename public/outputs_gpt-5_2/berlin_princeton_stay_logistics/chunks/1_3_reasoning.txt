**Designing HTML for styling**

I'm considering a handwriting-like font fallback like "Libre Baskerville" or "Georgia," while keeping things simple. I want to preserve line breaks with `<br>` and plan to create an HTML structure with `<div class="letter">`, centering with CSS and adding some margin. Adding a subtle border to mimic edges might not be necessary. They want MathJax to render expressions, but since there aren't any, including the script is optional. I'll commit to the surname "Kövari" and the city "Bü-". I'm a little unsure, but I'll proceed with care.
**Clarifying the surname spelling**

Alright, I'm trying to determine the correct spelling of the surname. After "Kö," I see a "v" shaped letter, then "a," "ri," and maybe "e." The image shows "Köri," but I also notice a potential "tt e" shape. It seems "Kövi" is short, but I think there might be more letters. The fourth line indicates "Kövri aus," where “aus” starts after a space, so it could be "Kövi" after all. I'm also checking if "Kövi" is a valid Hungarian surname, which it is, but there’s also "Kövesi."
**Transcribing the surname and crafting HTML**

I don't want to overfit this, so I'll go with "Kövi" as a possible surname. Alternatively, I could represent an unknown character with '�' for irony, but I think "Kövi" is the safer choice. I’ll finalize the line as "mit Frl. Mariette Kövi aus Bü-".

Now, for the HTML: I want to keep it simple, so I'll create a `<div class="page">` with a tissue-like background. I'll add CSS to center the content and create a pale paper background with black vertical edges to mimic a mourning border. I'll use a cursive-like font and ensure to preserve the original formatting, keeping line breaks intact.
**Crafting the HTML output**

I need to ensure that each line is enclosed in `<span>` tags and separated by `<br>` to maintain the formatting. My focus is solely on crafting the HTML code now. I'll make sure everything is structured properly without adding anything unnecessary. Alright, let's get to it and produce that HTML!
