**Splitting letter into chunks**

I need to divide a handwritten German letter into chunks. My goal is to output rectangles' coordinates covering text areas, ensuring no more than 8 lines per chunk and around 3-4 lines for any mathematical expressions. Since there aren't any mathematical expressions in this document, I can focus on keeping each chunk to 8 lines, capturing the full width of the page. I’ll take care to account for slightly skewed lines and overlaps too. The document's resolution is 961x768.
**Determining image resolution**

I’m analyzing an image with the resolution noted as 961x768. It likely means the height is 961 and the width is 768, indicating a tall portrait orientation. To confirm this, I noticed cropping coordinates that reflect the width of 768 and height of 961. I plan to slice the image into around 6 chunks, with each having about 6-8 lines. There’s a faint first line at the top margin, which I’ll count as a line too.
**Planning chunk divisions**

I’m going to include top header content in Chunk 1 and propose making 6 slices of the page. For Chunk 1, I'll consider the first 7-8 lines and focus on the area from around y  70 to y  210. The top border is approximately 35 px thick, so text starts around y=90. I'll split the total height of 961 into 6 equal parts, about 135 pixels each. To avoid splitting lines, I’ll plan on some overlap between the chunks while covering the full width from x1=40 to x2=728.
**Defining chunk dimensions**

The instruction says to include the entire width of the letter page in each chunk, which means I’ll use the full scanned page width of 768 pixels. So, I’ll set x1=0 and x2=767 for my coordinates. They didn’t specify whether these are inclusive or exclusive, but to be cautious, I’ll treat x2 and y2 as the endpoints within the image limits. So, for Chunk 1, I'll use coordinates like (0, 60, 767, 190), remembering that every line of text must be fully contained in one chunk.
**Finalizing chunk dimensions**

I’m setting up the chunks to ensure each line is fully contained in at least one. Since I'll use overlaps of about 20 pixels, I’ll create around 8 chunks with coordinates defined as necessary. Each chunk will cover the full width of the page, starting from x1=0 to x2=767. After inspecting heights, I’m defining the y intervals for 8 chunks while considering the margins and ensuring no lines will be cut. My final set of coordinates will be captured accurately, maintaining the text integrity within the overlaps and page dimensions.
**Preparing final output**

I remember that I need to use integer coordinates, and with the total height being 961, I’ll set y2 to 960 since it’s zero-indexed. We can have a maximum of ten chunks, but I’ll stick with 8. Now, I'll prepare the final output, listing each chunk's coordinates on separate lines, along with the resolution. I’m keeping it simple without any special formatting, just the lines as instructed.
