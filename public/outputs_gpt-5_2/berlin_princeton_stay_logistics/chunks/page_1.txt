**Clarifying image dimensions**

I need to output the width and height of the image, which appears to be 960 for width and 768 for height based on the resolution. However, I should note that the viewing area might say "resolution 960 768," and this indicates a portrait orientation despite the width and height suggesting otherwise. It seems like the image could potentially be rotated 90 degrees since it appears tall relative to its width. The presence of a thick black frame also suggests some rotation is involved.
**Determining image orientation**

The text in the image is upright, which suggests that the dimensions are indeed 960 for width and 768 for height, making it more horizontal than vertical. However, I'm questioning whether the vertical dimension might appear larger. I’ve noticed patterns where "resolution 768 768" indicates a square. Often, the width is larger than the height. But for this case, "resolution 960 768" seems to clearly state width and height. Also, we need to ensure the output coordinates reflect this correctly, taking into account any borders around the image.
**Defining image dimensions**

I want to ensure we include the whole width of each letter page in each chunk. So, I should consider setting x1 to the left inner grey margin. The instructions say to use the whole width of each letter page when reasonable. I think it might be best to count from x=0 to x=959 across the entire image width. But that could include some grey background, which might not be needed if cropping to just the page width is preferred. However, I’ll stick to the instructions given.
**Deciding chunk dimensions**

I’m thinking about setting x1 to 80 and x2 to 880 to cover the page width. But we don’t have pixel-level measurements; we’ll need to approximate and use integer coordinates. To be safe, I could go with x1=0 and x2=960 for the full image width to contain the lines properly. Now, I need to determine the number of chunks based on the lines per chunk. The page has a header with a small box and a date, then multiple body paragraphs. It looks like I should split it into 3 or 4 chunks with up to 8 lines each.
**Defining chunk regions**

I need to ensure that slanted lines are fully contained, so I’m focusing on the page structure. The header includes the small boxed address, greeting, and some lines of text extending down to $4000. It makes sense to break the content into 3 chunks. 

For Chunk 1, I’ll include the header and the first few lines, so I’m considering coordinates like (0, 0, 960, 350). For Chunk 2, I’ll extend this to capture more lines, setting it as (0, 320, 960, 610). Finally, Chunk 3 will cover the last lines, possibly (0, 580, 960, 768). I'll include overlaps to ensure everything is captured properly.
**Refining chunk coordinates**

I want to refine the y-values by visually estimating the lines. The top header text is about 40 px from the top, while the body might start around 180 px. I understand that lines need to be fully contained within the chunks, so it's okay to allow overlap. 

For Chunk 1, I’ll set the coordinates to (0, 0, 960, 400). Chunk 2 will be (0, 280, 960, 630), and Chunk 3 will be (0, 600, 960, 768). This overlap should help ensure that all lines are fully contained. The resolution is confirmed as 960 by 768. I’m ready to finalize these coordinates!
