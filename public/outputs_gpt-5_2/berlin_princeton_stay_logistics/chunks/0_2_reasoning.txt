**Transcribing text from image**

I need to transcribe all text in the image to HTML while keeping the formatting and line breaks intact. The image shows a letter written in German cursive, and I must use OCR to do this. Observing carefully, the text begins with "halten. Die Verpflichtungen sind:" and seems complete despite some parts being cut off. I'll note if any lines above are also partially visible, but it looks like I have what I need to start.
**Transcribing German text**

It looks like the first word "halten." is at the start of the line. In the image, it's positioned in the top-left, with "halten. Die Verpflichtungen sind:" visible and not cut off. There seems to be a partial line above, but this line is fully there. The next visible text is "2-3 Wochenstunden, er bietet dagegen," followed by "$4000 (inkl. Reisekosten)." The handwritten "$4000" has a larger "4," and I can confirm that the text does include "(inkl. Reisekosten)."
**Designing the HTML presentation**

I noticed there's a round embossed stamp labeled "DREIT... BINDON," but it's not essential for our project. The goal is to create an HTML representation with line breaks that's visually appealing yet simple. Since the user requested to "make it pretty," I plan to use CSS to create a styled card with a black border and a beige background color. I'll make a `<div class="card">` centered to give it a nice look and use an italic, cursive font for the text, including appropriate spacing and line breaks. MathJax will help render the math expression for "$4000."
**Preparing HTML with MathJax considerations**

I need to consider how to handle "$4000" properly since the dollar sign might conflict with HTML. While we've been asked to use MathJax for mathematical expressions, this particular case isn't truly a math expression. To avoid issues, I could represent the amount as plain text using `&dollar; 4000`. Now, I'll create the HTML structure, focusing on the card styling. I can use `<span class="line">...</span><br>` or a simple `<p>` tag with margins and line height to mimic handwriting. I may also add a `<div class="stamp">` for the embossed circular stamp, even though it wasn't part of the transcription request.
**Finalizing the HTML transcription**

I noticed that there's faint text in the image, like the embossed "DREITAN... BUNDON," but it's too unclear to include. I’ll focus on the legible handwritten lines: "halten. Die Verpflichtungen sind:", "2-3 Wochenstunden, er bietet dagegen," and "$4000 (inkl. Reisekosten)." For the HTML, I'll create a minimal block with a `<div class="letter">` style, using a cursive font and a thick black border. While they requested including MathJax, it seems unnecessary for this content. I’ll keep it simple and deliver the code!
