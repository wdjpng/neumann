**Transcribing German handwriting**

I need to transcribe text from an image showing German handwriting. I'll focus on the visible lines, ignoring any that are partially cut off, especially those at the top and sides with black borders. The first visible line starts with "soeben habe ich einen Brief von,” but there's some text that appears to be cut off above it, which is a bit tricky. I’ll ensure I only transcribe what I can see clearly.
**Transcribing details from the image**

In the image, it seems there's some previous line visible at the top, but the first clear line says, "soeben habe ich einen Brief von," which is centered and not cut off, so that looks good. The second line continues with "O. Veblen aus Princeton erhalten, der," while the third line reads "mir einen 4-Monatigen Aufenthalt." Even though the "M" is capital in the original handwriting, I'll transcribe it as "4-monatigen" to stay consistent in German. The fourth line is "in Princeton (für das Semester," and the fifth reads "5.2.1930. — 1.7.1930.) anbietet, u. w.," where "u. w." likely means "und wie."
**Transcribing the letter’s content**

I’m noticing that "u. w." is likely an abbreviation, and it comes right after "anbietet." The sixth line reads, "wie er mir mitteilt, um nach," but I’m wondering if it should be "wie es mir mitteilt." The scanned snippet seems to show "er," but I'll double-check. The next line says, "Ihrer Rückkehr nach Zürich," but perhaps it’s "Ihres Rückkehrs." This leads to "quantenmechanische Vorlesungen zu," which looks good. The last line reads, "halten. Die Verpflichtungen sind:" and it’s fully visible, so I’ll include that. I’ll format this nicely in HTML!
**Creating a letter in HTML format**

I want to use a nice, paper-like style with a centered "letter" container and a cursive font to mimic handwriting. I'll include line breaks using `<br>`, and even though there aren't any math formulas, I need to add the MathJax script in the header as requested. I have to provide a complete HTML document while keeping everything focused on accurate transcription. 

For the first line, it starts with "Soeben habe ich einen Brief von," and I'm considering that "Soeben" should be capitalized since it may follow a preceding line ending in " — soeben." I want to make sure the formatting and punctuation are just right.
**Creating formatted HTML for the letter**

I need to ensure the letter I’m formatting replicates the original closely, paying attention to capitalization and line breaks. The first line will be "soeben habe ich einen Brief von," keeping it lowercase as seen in the image. The second line continues with "O. Veblen aus Princeton erhalten, der," and I’ll note the correct hyphenation in "4-monatigen Aufenthalt."

I will create a stylish HTML container that imitates a handwritten letter, using CSS for font and background. I'm including the MathJax script as requested, even if there aren't formulas to render. Let's finalize the HTML structure, ensuring everything appears as intended.
