      <p>Dear Professor!</p>

      <p>Please excuse me for only now thanking you for your last letter and the information contained therein. I have definitively declined Baltimore.</p>

      <p>I have just received a letter from O. Veblen in Princeton offering me a 4-month stay in Princeton (for the semester February 5, 1930 – July 1, 1930), specifically, as he informs me, to give lectures on quantum mechanics after your return to Zurich. The obligations are: 2–3 hours per week; he offers in return $4000 (incl. travel expenses).</p>

      <p>I assume that this offer (considering American conditions) can be described as advantageous, and I would be particularly pleased and honored to come to the place where you worked for many years; consequently I intend to accept.</p>

      <p>On this occasion I would also like to inform you that I became engaged in October, to Miss Mariette Kövi of Budapest. —</p>

      <p>How I shall actually arrange the trip to America in view of these circumstances, I do not yet see at the moment, but I believe that it can in any case be managed.</p>

      <p>Scientifically I have learned little new here. Einstein is said to have composed a new edition of his theory. What do you think of Reichenbächer, Z. f. Ph. 58, 573.</p>

      <p>I am, with best regards, yours very truly</p>
