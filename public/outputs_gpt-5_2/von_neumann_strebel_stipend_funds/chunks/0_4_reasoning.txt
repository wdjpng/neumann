**Considering OCR requirements**

I need to OCR the text while preserving the formatting, especially for the header. This is about a handwritten letter, so I have to be careful about text that's cut off in the screenshot. I must ensure to include the MathJax script for any mathematical expressions, even if there aren’t any. I'm examining the left margin, where there's vertical writing that says "any case," but I'm not certain if we should include the vertical text since some might be cut off.
**Transcribing the handwritten text**

The vertical "any case" is fully visible; I think it's good to include. Moving on to the main text, it states, "Dr. Stabel has applied for a Swiss stipendium." But I'm unsure about the last name—it could be "Stähel" or maybe "Strebel." I’m leaning toward "Dr. Strebel" as it looks plausible. I also see a long struck-through line that includes the text "and it seems that it will be granted," which I can indicate using the <s> tag for strikethrough formatting.
**Reviewing the letter content**

The next line states, "which will enable him to go to America. We," with an inserted caret before "which." The word "(which)" seems to be the right choice since it's overwritten. The following part of the letter cuts off after "We," followed by an incomplete line that starts with "be." The instructions say I need to ignore partially cut-off lines, so I'll stop at "We." I also need to replicate the header, but there isn't one visible in this snippet.
**Designing the letter format**

I’m thinking of creating a stylized letter-like container using CSS to imitate a handwriting style, as they requested something pretty and artful. I’ll keep the line breaks intact and use `<div class=letter>` with a cursive font fallback. I'll also add `<p>` lines and `<span class=strike>` for the strikethroughs. There's a vertical note "any case" that can be styled with CSS by rotating it 90 degrees. I’ll also consider including the MathJax loader script in the head for mathematical expressions, along with a container of around 900 to 1000 pixels wide and a parchment background color.
