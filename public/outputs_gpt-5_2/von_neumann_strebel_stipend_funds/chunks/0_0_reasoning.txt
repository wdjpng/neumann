**Transcribing letter contents**

I see the "SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS" in small type with a date of "January 23, 1953." I’m considering how to replicate margins and fonts using CSS. The body should have a typewriter font, and I think the header could use small caps. There’s also vertical handwriting on the left margin — I might need a rotated div for that. However, I'm uncertain about including ambiguous scribbles; if content is unclear, it’s better to omit. Following instructions means fully transcribing all text, but including a placeholder might be wise for any unclear parts.
**Deciphering letter content**

I'm trying to decode the text from the bottom left, where "cordially" is clearly present and written vertically. I’m seeing letters like c o r d i a l l y swirled upwards. The preceding words could be "Yours" or "Sincerely," which are common letter closings. Above "cordially," there seems to be a phrase like "something you sent me," possibly something like "Thanks you sent me." However, given that parts are potentially cut off, it may be safer to omit the unclear handwritten note.
**Following transcribing instructions**

The instruction is clear: I need to completely ignore any lines of text that are partially cut off from the screenshot. It seems the vertical scribble on the left, along with some bottom lines, may not be fully visible, so I can justify ignoring those. I should focus on including the letterhead, school line, date, greeting, and the first paragraph lines that are fully visible. 

So, I’ll copy the text: 
"Dear van der Waerden: 
Thank you for your letter of January 18 concerning Dr. Kurt Strebel. His credentials look good to me, but our stipend funds for 1953-54 are already largely exhausted. It is, nevertheless, not impossible that we may be able to do..." 

I'll verify punctuation, spacing, and hyphenation carefully!
**Creating HTML structure**

I need to replicate the original typed format, which likely uses two spaces after periods; I’ll make sure to include that. The "SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS" should be in small caps on the left. For the layout, the header should be centered at the top with the date aligned to the right as "January 23, 1953." 

I’ll write the HTML with a basic structure that has an off-white background and uses the "Georgia" font for the letterhead. It’s important to keep line breaks for readability, and maybe use a fixed width container to keep things neat. I’ll make sure the header and subheader are styled properly — the main header should be in uppercase and spaced widely, while "PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY" will be smaller and also in uppercase. Let's keep it simple but appealing!
**Formatting HTML content**

I’ll use absolute positioning to format the document, starting with the date aligned to the right. The body paragraph will be in the typewriter font 'Courier New.' The text will look like this:

THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY

PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY

SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS

January 23, 1953

Dear van der Waerden:

Thank you for your letter of January 18 concerning Dr. Kurt Strebel. His credentials look good to me, but our stipend funds for 1953-54 are already largely exhausted. It is, nevertheless, not impossible that we may be able to do...

I notice the last line ends with “do” and continues off-screen, so I’ll only include fully visible lines. I’ll ensure the original body width is replicated, with appropriate indentation of about five spaces. I’ll set line breaks as shown in the image and format the HTML accordingly. No need for MathJax since there aren't any mathematical expressions to render, just the HTML code!
