**Clarifying text visibility**

I'm pondering the visibility of text in an image that shows only part of a page, which might mean some lines are visible, but others could be incomplete. The cropping cuts off sentences or characters, especially on the right side, but might leave other text, like the header "SCHOOL OF," visible. But since it's part of a longer header, do we treat it as cut? The instruction specifically tells us to ignore partially cut-off lines. It's a bit confusing!
**Interpreting cropped text instructions**

It seems that if lines extend beyond the crop, we should ignore them. But that could lead to overlooking nearly everything on the page since it’s cropped. I think the intention might be to avoid transcribing incomplete lines at the edges. For instance, cut-off lines at the top and bottom can be ignored, but not the ones in the middle. It’s a little ambiguous. However, I see "SCHOOL OF" clearly typed in uppercase and some handwritten notes that might say "Yours most cordially."
**Identifying readable text fragments**

I’m trying to piece together the text I can read. I see "Yours most cordially" clearly, along with "Dr. S," although the rest of that line is cut off. There’s also an underlined "and" and a word that looks like “have.” Additionally, I’m noticing "If n," but I’m a bit unsure about that. Above "Dr. S" is just an "M." I think it’s best to include fragments like "SCHOOL OF," "Yours most cordially," "M," "Dr. S," "and," "have," and "If," then lay these out neatly in a vertical format.
**Designing the text layout**

I’m thinking about how to represent the text visually. I can use CSS to rotate the margin notes for a diagonal effect, but I want to keep it straightforward. The header "SCHOOL OF" isn’t fancy, and I should align it center-right or maybe left within a decorative page container styled like a serif font. While some parts may be cut off, the letter "M" is a little ambiguous, but it might still be readable. Overall, I want to provide a clear representation without overcomplicating things.
