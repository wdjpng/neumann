**Considering handwriting style**

I'm considering how to replicate handwriting style in HTML. Maybe a script font would work, but I want to "make it pretty" and artfully capture a letter's essence. While there's no header, I could use a cursive font with preserved line breaks. However, I can't load external fonts due to limitations. I might refer to generic "cursive" instead. I'll also think of simple inline CSS using common fonts and explore a parchment-colored background. The task asks to fully transcribe the text from the image, starting with "Dear Von Neumann," possibly including that comma.
**Transcribing the letter**

The image shows "Dear Von Neumann," possibly with a trailing ">" but I'll just write "Dear Von Neumann." The next line says, "Many thanks for your letter of Jan. 23," which seems correct. Then, there's "Dr. Strobel has applied for a Swiss stipendium," but I'm second-guessing if it's "Strobel," "Strobl," or even "Stäbel." Looking at the letters, it seems more likely to be "Strobel." The text continues past "stipendium," but I'll stop at the visible comma, as that part appears complete.
**Crafting HTML for the letter**

I'm getting ready to create an HTML structure for the letter. I'll use a container with appropriate width and margin, applying monospace or pre formatting to maintain the line breaks. Each line will be wrapped in a "div" with a "letter" class for styling, possibly using <span class="indented">. I'll make sure to only present the three lines and ignore any unnecessary vertical margins.

Here’s a quick outline of the structure: it includes the standard head, body, styles, and the actual letter content. Each line is already in its own div, so we’re good there!
