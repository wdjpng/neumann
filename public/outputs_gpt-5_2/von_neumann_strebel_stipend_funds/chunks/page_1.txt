**Splitting image into chunks**

I need to split an image of a letter page into chunks with coordinates. Since it only contains text and no math, I should focus on ensuring each line of text is fully included in the chunk, ideally keeping to 2-4 lines of math. I'll also aim for up to 8 lines per chunk while capturing the full width of each page. The tricky part is identifying the exact edges since there's a background border. I'll work to ensure it captures the complete width reasonably.
**Determining image chunking**

I’ve decided it’s safe to use the entire width of the image, including the background. First, I need to split the content, starting with the header lines (title and location), date, salutation, body paragraphs (perhaps two), closing signature, and footer addresses along with initials. There’s also a handwritten note at the bottom and some scribbles along the left vertical margin. I’ll ensure each line is inside a bounding box, even if they overlap, especially in the margin scribbles. Chunks can span the full width for the typed text sections.
**Organizing image chunks**

I’m realizing that while I want to include full-width chunks, the vertical marginalia on the left side complicates things. It stretches the entire height of the page but doesn't need to be part of the typed sections. Each line must be in at least one chunk, even if they're separate. I can create a chunk for the vertical handwritten text, which is fine since it could overlap other chunks. I’ll likely aim for 6-8 total chunks.  

For Chunk 1, I’ll gather the header area, including the institute name, city, and the small "School of Mathematics" note. The header has 2-3 lines, plus the date, so I’ll ensure it doesn’t exceed 8 lines in total.
**Determining image resolution**

I need to figure out the header area’s endpoint, which I estimate is around 200 on the y-axis. First, I have to confirm the image's resolution, which appears to be 984x768. The metadata shows width as 984 and height as 768, but the orientation seems odd since the height is greater than the width — it suggests it's in portrait mode. I need to remember that the typical order is width x height, meaning the canvas looks like it’s portrait-sized within a landscape orientation. The effective width of the page likely fits within about 630 pixels.
**Setting integer coordinates**

I need to provide integer coordinates for the chunks. It makes sense to use the full image width (from 0 to 983) because the instructions say to include the entire width of each letter page. For the x-coordinates, I’ll set x1=0 and x2=983 to keep it safe. The left margin’s vertical handwritten notes might be around x=20, but using full-width boxes means I need to limit excess line count in each chunk. 

For Chunk A, I’ll estimate the x-range for the vertical note to be approximately 10 to 85, but I might include from x=0 to around 140 to ensure I’m capturing everything. Since I need to avoid exceeding the 8 lines of text rule, I can specifically design this left margin box to include the vertical note while keeping typed lines minimal, ensuring that every line is fully contained in one of the chunks. I could also treat the left margin scribbles as two vertical phrases, including both for safety with taller boxes.
**Creating chunks for text**

I’m planning to create two narrower chunks for the vertical text. For Chunk L1, I'll include the far left outer margin from about x=10 to 60 and y=0 to 300 to ensure full coverage. Chunk L2 will capture the inner diagonal text along the left side from x=60 to about 170 and y=100 to 760, covering that text. 

For the main content, I'll chunk the header with important details like the institute name, ensuring to include the "School of Mathematics" line, which will make for a total of around 3-4 lines. The salutation and first paragraph will be split into two chunks, keeping under the 8-line rule.

Next, I'll capture the closing and footer, with the handwritten note also separated. This will help manage the file without exceeding the maximum line limit per chunk. I’ve assigned estimated y-coordinates for each chunk based on careful observation of the image layout, ensuring we’re capturing all necessary elements while allowing for some overlaps where needed. So, the final chunk list will have 8 sections while maintaining clear organization!
**Checking chunk line counts**

I'm going through the line counts for each chunk to ensure they comply with the required limits. 

Chunk 1 contains around 4 typed lines plus a small label, which is fine. Chunk 2 has a salutation with about 6-7 lines, good too. Chunk 3 holds the remainder of the paragraph with around 7 lines.

As I finalize the coordinates, I'm setting ranges to ensure all lines are included without splitting. I've refined those ranges, and I think we're ready to output the final coordinate pairs and image resolution based on my checks!
