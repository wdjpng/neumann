        Dear Professor! Please excuse me for only now answering your two letters. In the meantime I was in Budapest for several weeks because my father unexpectedly died last month from an ulcer. —
      </p>

      <p>
        Since you inform me that you have written to them directly yourself, I have undertaken nothing in this regard. Your work, incidentally, interested me very much, and in fact convinced me that Dirac's agreement with normal general relativity theory can be brought into accord. My earlier concern about Heisenberg's program related solely to the fact that it could not be purely mechanical and without a new form—
      </p>

      <p>
        How does the situation stand regarding the four-component theory?
      </p>

      <p>
        Have you seen Pauli-Heisenberg's work? It seems likely to miss the essence of the 'elementary process' as a result of the inherited vice of Lorentz's theory and <sup>*)</sup> relativity theory, but it is nevertheless impressive that it is strictly relativistic and does not collide with transformation theory either! What do you think of it? —
      </p>

      <p>
        Eight weeks ago I negotiated here with a Prof. F. D. Murnaghan from Baltimore who wanted to import Europeans to Johns Hopkins, that is, he made me an offer for an "associate" position at $3000 per year, provisionally for one year. I did not consider it very advantageous, but subsequently declined <i>a limine</i> because due to my father's death I did not want to leave Europe in the winter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now Prof. Murnaghan offers me the same position "for February 1st — June 1st" with $1,500 (for these 4 months). I would actually like to make such a short trip to America, but I believe the offer is still not materially favorable enough. I would be very grateful if you would tell me, based on your American experience, whether I am right and how the matter should be valued.
      </p>

      <p>
        Will you still be in Princeton in spring 1930? —
      </p>

      <p>
        In the hope of seeing you again, with best regards, and with the request that you convey my hand-kiss to your wife,
      </p>
