**Transcribing text from image**

I need to transcribe text from an image to HTML while keeping the formatting and line breaks intact. The handwriting appears to be German cursive. I should zoom in on the text, which begins with "relativitätstheorie am Wesen des Ele- ... mentarprozesses wohl vorbeigehen." It seems like it's a continuation of a sentence, possibly starting with "Relativitätstheorie am Wesen des Elementarprozesses wohl vorbeigehen." I need to pay attention to the lines, especially those that are fully visible despite some partial cut-off.
**Reading handwriting details**

It looks like the top line might be cut off a bit, but the first line is fully visible, which is great. The text reads: "relativitätstheorie am Wesen des ele- mentarprozesses wohl vorbeigehen." I think it should be "Relativitätstheorie am Wesen des 'elementarprozesse' wohl vorbeigehen," but there's a small raised quote after "elementarprozesse." I noticed some interesting details: there's a hyphen at the line break, and there seems to be a duplication of "es." It should likely just be "aber es ist doch imponierend."
**Analyzing text details**

The image includes the phrase "aber es es ist doch imponierend." It seems like it should be just "aber es ist doch imponierend," since there's a scribble indicating that. I need to be precise, but I think it’s safe to assume it’s a single "es." The next lines include "dass sie streng relativistisch ist" followed by "und mit der Transformationstheo-" and then "rie auch nicht kollidiert! Was halten Sie davon?" 

Finally, there's a section about a professor, "F.D. Murnaghan," who is a mathematician. The last line appears to be cut off, but I’ll keep the visible parts.
**Preparing to format text**

The screenshot indicates that there are additional lines cut off, but the last visible line seems intact. The word "aus" is fully visible, so we should include the last lines that can be seen. I’ll ensure the transcription is in HTML with proper line breaks. Although there's no header to replicate, I’ll create a simple `<div class="letter">` for the typography. 

CSS will help simulate a cursive font, but I’ll keep the formatting minimal. The user also mentioned MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions, even though there aren't any in this text. I'll embed the script just in case!
**Crafting HTML for transcription**

I’ll create an HTML skeleton to transcribe the content with simple styling. We want a paper-like background, margins, and a font that mimics handwriting, like Georgia or Times. It's essential to maintain line breaks, especially for hyphenated words like "Transformationstheo- rie.”

I’ll include quotes around "Elementarprozesses" and ensure proper capitalization for "Relativitätstheorie." It looks like we need to preserve the exact formatting with a `<pre>` tag for line breaks.

Additionally, I'll add a style block and even a MathJax script, even if no math is present, just to follow the user's request. It's all about accuracy and presentation!
