**Chunking the image**

I'm focusing on splitting the image into rectangular chunks. Each chunk should contain no more than 2-4 lines of math expressions, but since this is a handwritten letter in German, there may not be actual math equations. The instruction is to have roughly eight lines of text and accommodate the entire width of the letter when possible. Overlapping is allowed to ensure each line is fully contained due to curved lines. I’ll also provide the coordinates for the chunks.
**Confirming image resolution**

I'm trying to figure out the image resolution since the text lines are handwritten and slightly slanted. The dimensions seem to be 1025 x 768, but I'm not quite sure about the orientation. The preview states “resolution 1025 768 look,” which might mean height is 1025 and width is 768. However, it appears like it’s oriented as a portrait with a narrow width, meaning the final resolution should likely be (768, 1025). I need to confirm this!
**Defining image dimensions and coordinates**

The alt text mentions “resolution 1025 768,” suggesting the dimensions are height 1025 px and width 768 px. I’ll use (768, 1025) for clarity. We need to output coordinates for each chunk within the letter area. There's about a 10 px margin from the outer border, which is a black line. Since they want the entire width of the letter page included, I can set x1=0 and x2=767. I’ll also need to partition this vertically into segments, keeping in mind to count the lines accurately!
**Estimating text lines**

This seems to be a continuation of the previous thought. I’m estimating the lines of text in the image, and I've identified several lines, starting with “manen Ansatz gehen kann,” and continuing through to “mit einem Prof. F. D.” 

Counting these, it looks like I have about 15 lines with varying lengths. I need to keep this list handy as I plan how to organize these text chunks. This will help in processing the handwritten text effectively!
**Structuring text chunks**

I'm organizing the text lines into chunks, estimating around 21 lines in total. I plan to create three chunks, each containing no more than 8 lines. The dimensions of the chunks will be adjusted to ensure lines are fully contained, with overlaps to avoid cutting lines. 

For chunking, I'll set coordinates like this: 

- Chunk 1: (0, 90, 767, 380)
- Chunk 2: (0, 340, 767, 700)
- Chunk 3: (0, 660, 767, 1024)

This way, I can ensure that all lines, including the footnote, are included properly!
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I've decided on the chunk coordinates while ensuring we don't crop any important parts. Since the user wants between 2 to 10 chunks, I'll stick to three, and it's important to ensure we don't exceed the lines per chunk. I checked, and it appears that chunk three still fits within the guidelines. 

Now, I'll finalize the output format for the coordinates, making sure to include parentheses and adhere to the width requirements. The final coordinates will be:

(0, 90, 767, 380)  
(0, 340, 767, 700)  
(0, 660, 767, 1024)  
(768, 1025)
