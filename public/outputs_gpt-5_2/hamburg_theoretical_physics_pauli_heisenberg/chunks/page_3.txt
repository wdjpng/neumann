**Clarifying image resolution**

I need to clarify the resolution of the image, which is stated as 1004x768. This suggests a width of 1004 and a height of 768, indicating a landscape orientation. However, the image looks more portrait with a taller appearance. There might be some padding influencing this perception. So, while the resolution is indeed 1004x768, it seems like the image may be rotated 90 degrees, making it taller than wide. I'll make sure to report the dimensions accurately.
**Defining image resolution and dimensions**

I want to confirm that the resolution of "1004 768" indicates the displayed image has dimensions of 1004 by 768 pixels. The next step is to choose rectangle coordinates that cover the letter page area while considering the surrounding margins. To be thorough, I should include almost the full width of the page without the entire blank background. Although it's tricky to define "page width" in a scanned image, I think using the full image width will ensure all lines are captured clearly. It's acceptable to include some background if necessary.
**Segmenting image into chunks**

I prefer to focus on just the width of the page, even though pinpointing the exact edges might be tricky. I can create approximate bounding boxes that cover most of the image width to capture full lines and keep my chunks manageable with no more than 8 lines each. I’m planning to divide the content into 3 or 4 chunks. 

Based on the image height of 768, the top margin is around 30 pixels, and the first line of handwriting starts around 90 pixels. For chunk definitions, I'll set Chunk 1 from y=40 to y=210, and Chunk 2 from y=200 to y=370.
**Defining final chunks**

For Chunk 3, I'll set the coordinates from y=360 to y=540 to capture the next 5-6 lines. Chunk 4 will range from y=530 to y=720, including any small footnotes at the bottom, like that note near y=730. The last line of text appears to be around y=690-730, so I'll define Chunk 4 to include up to y=767 for safety.

To ensure every line or math expression is fully contained within one chunk, I’ll add an overlap of 30-40 pixels between adjacent chunks. I want to include the entire width of the page, setting x1 at 0 and x2 at 1003 to account for any background margins.
**Finalizing chunk definitions**

I’m determining the chunk definitions, focusing on including the page width rather than the full image width. However, using the entire image width is also fine, so I’ll set x1 at 0 and x2 at 1003, ensuring my coordinates stay within valid ranges.

I’ve now adjusted the y coordinates for my chunks to provide overlaps of 30 pixels. This means:

- Chunk 1: (0, 0, 1003, 220)
- Chunk 2: (0, 190, 1003, 410)
- Chunk 3: (0, 380, 1003, 600)
- Chunk 4: (0, 570, 1003, 767)

Lastly, I’ll confirm that every line is fully contained within each chunk and also state that the resolution is (1004, 768).
