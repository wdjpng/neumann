**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to OCR handwritten German script from an image of a letter and fully transcribe all text to HTML. I'll maintain line breaks and approximate formatting, while ignoring any partially cut-off lines. There's a possible footnote line that’s partially cut off, but I’ll focus only on fully visible content. The first line appears to begin with “westen ist” but seems to start mid-word. I need to ensure I accurately transcribe all legible lines.
**Transcribing German text**

I see the phrase "westen ist" but might be interpreting it as "wessen." The instruction says to fully transcribe the text, so I should include that first line as shown, even though it feels contextually incomplete. The line isn’t cut off at the top but is missing a piece on the left. Moving on, the next lines read: "Sind Sie noch im Frühling 1930 in Princeton? —" and "In der Hoffnung des Wiedersehens," followed by "mit den besten Grüssen." The spelling of "Grüssen" leans towards an older style.
**Analyzing German text**

In the text, I see "besten Grussen," possibly referring to "Grüßen" with an old Swiss style in mind. There are quotes around "Grüßen," and I notice a double quote mark after "besten." At the bottom, there's an underlined note that might be partially cut off, but could still be fully visible despite the instructions to ignore partial lines. It starts with "*," and I'm trying to determine whether it's "diese Option meinerseits zum bleiben." The letters seem to blend, but "zum bleiben" might be underlined, suggesting emphasis.
**Examining underlined text**

I notice there's an underline under "mit den besten Grüssen," which might indicate the entire phrase is emphasized. Below that, there's a footnote starting with "*," seemingly incomplete and likely reading "*diese Option meinerseits zum bleiben." To ensure accuracy, I’m considering marking uncertain letters with brackets, but since the goal is to fully transcribe everything, I'll do my best. The last footnote may be partially cut off, so I think it's best to avoid including it in the transcription.
**Finalizing transcription**

I’m realizing the note within the frame isn’t cropped at the bottom, maybe just faint. However, the instructions say to ignore partially cut-off lines, yet this note appears fully visible. The first line looks like "werten ist," but since it could start with either 'w' or 'u,' I’ll lean towards "werten." The second and third lines will read "Sind Sie noch im Frühling 1930 in Princeton? —" and "In der Hoffnung des Wiedersehens," followed by "mit den besten Grüssen." The spelling of "Grüssen" indicates a Swiss variant, likely nodding towards the author. For the final note, it looks uncertain, so I'll opt for the portion that's clearer, while keeping the HTML formatting neat, ensuring it mimics the handwritten style as much as possible!
**Creating HTML for transcription**

I'll go with "westen ist" in lowercase as it continues "im westen ist." The first line is set. For line five, I’ll underline it using CSS. I’m omitting the unclear footnote for now, thinking it would be better to include something like "*die Option meinerseits zum bleiben," but marking it uncertain isn’t necessary. I’ll finalize the text along with the exclamation after "Grüssen." 

We’ll output the HTML structure, using a container for style and ensuring to maintain line breaks. I’ll include diacritics and create stylish formatting, all while being careful to adhere to the request for just the HTML code. Let’s structure it clearly!
