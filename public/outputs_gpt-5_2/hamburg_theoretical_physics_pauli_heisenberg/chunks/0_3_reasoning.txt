**Transcribing and formatting**

I'm not sure about the exact process, but it seems they want an extraction and comparison of some text. Given the risk involved, it's possible that the dataset will acknowledge the difficulty in reading handwriting, yet the instructions suggest transcribing it anyway. I’ll put together my best guess of the text lines and implement formatting in HTML. I’ll make it visually appealing, using a light style to resemble a piece of paper without needing any MathJax for this particular task.
**Crafting HTML format**

They stated, "Output only HTML code," so I need to consider if I really need the <html> root tag. Instead, I’ll create a minimal document using <div> for structure. They want it to look nice, but there's no header to replicate. I think I can include CSS to mimic handwriting with a cursive font and add margins. It’s important to preserve line breaks, so I’ll use <pre> tags for that. Let’s format the content accordingly and make a stylish <div> to look like a card!
**Maintaining formatting**

The instruction emphasizes keeping the formatting as close to the original as possible, so I definitely want to add a border. It’s important to ensure that the visual elements align well with the original content. I’ll craft the code accordingly to make sure it reflects that intention. I think I can create that appealing look while preserving the essence of the original formatting. Let’s go ahead and put this code together!
