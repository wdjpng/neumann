**Transcribing text to HTML**

I need to fully transcribe the image text to HTML while keeping line breaks and any formatting. Including uncertain characters in brackets might not be as accurate, but I'll aim for precision. I should replicate the horizontal line between main text and footnote using <hr> or <div style>. The quotes around "associate" need to be included, as does the dollar amount. MathJax might be used for the "β" without needing it for the dollar sign. I'll focus on producing clean HTML code while replicating styling as much as possible.
**Designing a styled container**

I'm thinking about creating a minimal styled container and want to use a handwriting-like font, maybe something like 'Cursive.' The phrase "make it pretty" suggests I can add CSS to mimic a paper feel while preserving line breaks. I need to focus on being as accurate as possible, while I won't worry about partial lines since they aren't present. The first line starts mid-sentence, so I’ll transcribe the main text accurately beginning with "einem Prof. F. D."
**Transcribing main text and footnote**

I'm working on transcribing the text, including "Murnaghan aus Baltimore verhandelt, der 'Europäer' nach Johns Hopkins importieren wollte." He made an application for an 'associate' position with a salary of $3,000 a year, although there’s a comma at the end of "vorläufig," implying it may continue on the next line, which I'll include.

Okay, there's an underline that should be replicated with `<hr class="hand-underline">`. Now for the footnote: "Ich meine: Unendliche kleine Ruhemasse des Punktelektrons, Ladungswechsel, β-Emissionen!" I see parts like "Unendliche," "kleine," and "Ruhemasse" clearly.
**Finalizing the footnote transcription**

I'm working on the transcription of the footnote, which begins with "Ich meine: Unendlich kleine Ruhemasse des Punktelektrons, Ladungswechsel, β-Emissionen!" I verified that I see "Punktelektrons" and "Ladungswechsel" clearly. 

There seems to be a single line wrapping in the image after the underline, although it looks like two lines might be overlapping due to scribbles. However, since they asked for exact line breaks, I'll keep it as one line for clarity. I'll definitely include "β-Emissionen!" as it is.
