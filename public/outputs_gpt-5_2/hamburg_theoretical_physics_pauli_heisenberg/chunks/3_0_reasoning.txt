**Analyzing address formatting**

I’m trying to understand the address formatting I came across. It seems the writer might have used German style: "Budapest-Schwabenberg, I. Str. Eötvös út 15." "Schwabenberg" is the German name for Svábhegy, while "I. Str." could be short for "I. Strasse." But, "Eötvös út" translates to "Eötvös Street" in Hungarian. 

I wonder if "I. Str." really represents something else, like "I. B." or "I. Bk."? I'm thinking I could transcribe the characters more faithfully as I see them.
**Clarifying transcription details**

There’s an underlined segment between previous scribbles that seems significant. It likely reads "I. B.: Eötvös ut 15." but I'm unsure if there's a colon after "B." At one point, I think I spotted "I. B." followed by an "E," but actually, there might not be a colon. The pattern could be "I. B: Eötvös ut (15.)." 

I could just transcribe as I see it, like "(vom 1.8. an Budapest-Schwabenhegy, I. B., Eötvös út 15.)", though the writer used 'ut' without the accent. I also need to keep the original formatting intact while noting there are no math formulas.
**Assessing text visibility**

I need to check the visibility of the text in the screenshot. The top line starts with "meinen Hand..." and appears partially cut off on the left. However, it seems fully visible horizontally, even though the top part of some letters might be clipped. According to the instructions, we should ignore any text that's partially cut off, but this line seems fully included—just the earlier lines are missing. 

Even though the top line doesn't appear cut off by the upper border, there's still cropping on the left side to consider.
**Clarifying text transcription**

The instruction is clear: I should completely ignore any lines of text that are partially cut off in the screenshot. Here, the left margin looks fine, and it seems nothing is cut. I see a line above "bin ich..." that looks like it says "meinen hands..." which is fully visible. 

Looking further, there's another complete line above that, possibly "die wollen," which ends with a comma. I should transcribe both lines. 

But wait; "meinen Handschuss übermitteln" doesn't seem right—maybe it's supposed to be "Handzeichen" or "Unterschrift" instead of "Handschuss." I need to inspect closely!
**Crafting HTML content**

I’m putting together an HTML
