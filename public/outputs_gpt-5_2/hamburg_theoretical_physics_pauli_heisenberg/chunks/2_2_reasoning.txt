**Transcribing image text**

I need to transcribe all the text visible in this image to HTML while keeping the formatting and line breaks. The screenshot has German cursive handwriting on beige paper. I’ll only include text lines that are fully visible, so I should ignore any that are partially cut off. The uppermost complete line starts with "noch immer nicht günstig genug ist," and I’ll include this line while skipping anything that's not fully visible.
**Analyzing visible lines**

I'm examining the text to determine which lines can be included. The line "noch immer nicht günstig genug ist" seems fully visible, even though there's a cut at the left margin. The instructions say to ignore lines that are partially cut off, but this line is okay to use since it’s complete. Then, I see "Ich wäre Ihnen recht dankbar," and I want to ensure I get the umlauts and eszett correct. That looks good!
**Examining hyphenated lines**

The next line reads, "wenn Sie mir auf Grund Ihrer Ame-," which has a hyphen at the end. It seems to continue with "rika-Erfahrungen sagen würden, ob." So, the word "Amerika" is hyphenated across the line break. The visible portion of the text shows "rika- Erfahrungen," but I need to check if there's a space before "Erfahrungen." Typically, it should be "Amerika-Erfahrungen," and it seems people often format hyphens with a space. I'll keep that in mind for transcription.
**Transcribing contextually accurate lines**

I’ll replicate "rika- Erfahrungen" with a space after the hyphen to keep it accurate. The next line reads, "ich recht habe bzw. wie die Sach zu." I’m thinking about whether it should be "ich recht habe" or "ich Recht habe," since "Recht" as a noun would be capitalized. The context suggests it’s likely "wie die Sache zu werten ist." The last line shows "werten ist," and the second to last ends with "Sache zu," making "Sache" more probable. I'll go with that!
**Creating HTML structure**

I’ll render the word "Sache" accurately now, while earlier I mentioned "amerika-Erfahrungen," but it should be "Amerika-Erfahrungen." I'll absolutely replicate the hyphenation and formatting as it appears in the image, including the line breaks. 

The first visible line is "noch immer nicht günstig genug ist," so I’ll start with that. I need to output pure HTML, ensuring to apply proper styling and diacritics using HTML entities where necessary. The container will mimic a handwritten letter, using a cursive font and maintaining the requested formatting. 

I’ll finalize the HTML structure carefully, adding the content lines with <br> tags and ensuring everything looks tidy!
