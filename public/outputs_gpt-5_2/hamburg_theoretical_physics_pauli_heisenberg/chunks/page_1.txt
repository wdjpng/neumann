**Splitting image into chunks**

I need to split the handwritten German letter image into 2-10 rectangular chunks. Each chunk can contain up to eight lines of text, as mathematical expressions aren’t present. I’ll follow guidelines to avoid crossing lines and ensure all text is included fully. The image width is about 768 pixels based on the resolution, which will help in determining how I chunk the text while also considering overlaps. Let's confirm the resolution details!
**Clarifying image resolution**

I’m trying to confirm the image resolution from the prompt, which states "resolution 1010 768." It looks like width might actually be 768 and height 1010, especially since the image is in portrait orientation. The description is a bit tricky to parse, but typically height should exceed width in this setup. I need to ensure I output the correct numbers for width and height, clearly stated as "resolution (width, height)." So, it seems like the final details are 768 for width and 1010 for height.
**Determining image orientation**

I'm reviewing resolution details, and it's a bit tricky here! The earlier tasks mentioned "resolution 1024 768" for landscape, but this image is in portrait orientation. The mention of "1010 768" could mean height is actually 1010 and width is 768, but it’s not entirely clear. Since the image is taller than it is wide, I’ll go with the resolution of (768, 1010). It seems the first number should represent height, despite some inconsistencies in the past. Let's finalize that output!
**Planning chunk division**

I need to ensure we get the output correct without guessing, and we'll base our bounding boxes on typical coordinates. The width will be 768 and the height 1010. For the margins, I’ll set the x-coordinates from 20 to 740, and the y-coordinates from 0 to 1009. I’ll divide the text into about five chunks, each covering 6-8 lines. The header will include "Hs. 91: 683" in the top left and "Hamburg, den 22.7.1929" in the top right, so I’ll keep that in mind as I work on the chunking.
