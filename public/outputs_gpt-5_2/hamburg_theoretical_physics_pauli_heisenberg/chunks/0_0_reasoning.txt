**Transcribing German text**

I need to transcribe the text in the image into HTML while preserving the formatting and adding MathJax where it's necessary. I should ignore partially cut-off lines. The handwritten letter is in German, and I can see key details like "Hs. 91; 683" with a semicolon. The date, "Hamburg, den 22.7.1929," looks good. Then there's "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" but the handwriting might suggest it says "geehrte." I’ll analyze the differences carefully.
**Transcribing careful details**

I see the scanned segment shows "Sehr geehrte Herr Professor!" but the last 'r' isn't clear. The standard phrase should actually be "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" I'm examining the handwriting closely; the 't e r' could be 't e'. Since this is a letter to a male professor, I'd normally use "geehrter," but I need to stick to what’s visible. The next lines say "entschuldigen Sie bitte," possibly mentioning the response to two letters, but it's cut off at the bottom, which I’ll ignore per the guidelines.
**Transcribing visible lines**

I see that the line "ten, ich war inzwischen meh-" is partially cut off. The lower portion of the image shows a descent to about two lines, which means the next line likely continues beyond the cropped part. If the baseline is fully visible, it should be included, but it looks like we can't include the next line since it's mostly cropped off. The visible line can be transcribed, though! I'll start with “Hs. 91; 683” in faded pencil, and the header "Hamburg, den 22.7.1929" should be right-aligned and italicized.
**Formatting handwritten text**

I’m noticing the text is grey and handwritten, so I think we should format it in a monospaced style. The goal is to keep it simple, using <div> with classes and italic formatting, plus line breaks with <br>. To simulate a letter card, I could use a container with a background and inline styles, which should be acceptable. 

I'll reconstruct the text, starting with "Hs. 91; 683" as a small top-left note, followed by "Hamburg, den 22.7.1929." Then, for the body, I'll go with "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" and decipher whether it says "geehrter" or "geehrte."
