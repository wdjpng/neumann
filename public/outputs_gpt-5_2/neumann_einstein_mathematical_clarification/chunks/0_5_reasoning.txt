**Transcribing image text**

I need to transcribe text from an image to HTML while keeping the formatting close to the original. It’s important to include line breaks and use MathJax for any math expressions. I’ll ignore lines that are partially cut off, starting from the top. The first visible lines seem to begin with "Wäre es nicht..." but there's a cutoff. We should only consider fully visible lines, so let’s focus on those.
**Assessing line visibility**

I’m checking if the top line is fully visible. It starts on the left side, which has a blank margin, so it looks like it’s not cut off. The beginning is a bit ambiguous with "Wäre es nicht durchsichtiger und einfa," but it appears to be fully visible since the only partial line is above it. I’ll include "Wäre es nicht..." and the next line "cher so vorzugehen:" along with the underlined "Hilfssatz 1." and following lines like "Wie bei Ihnen auf S. 130."
**Decoding math formulas**

At the bottom, there are math formulas written as "x(5 p) = x(5), x(19) = 5 g x(5)." I need to decode them carefully. The writing might be difficult since "19" could actually be "15" or maybe "1 9," which complicates things. I should extract this with precision, avoiding any misinterpretation. The goal is to provide an HTML transcription that includes math expressions using MathJax since the original handwriting might represent a German mathematician’s work. I’ll proceed cautiously!
**Transcribing math conditions**

I’m looking at some math scribbles that say "x(5p) = x(5), x(1 p) = δ," and I’m trying to clarify them. The "p" might be the Greek letter "ρ," which suggests that x(5p) equals x(5). After the comma, there’s "x(15) = 5 g x(5)," where "g" could represent "∂g." There are also crossed-out sections beneath, and some preceding text. I want to transcribe everything accurately, especially the lines like "Wäre es nicht durchsichtigter und einfa-" with "durchsichtiger" spelled correctly.
**Finalizing HTML for transcription**

I’m working on the HTML script for the transcription. The text includes "Wäre es nicht durchsichtigter und einfa-" which I’ve decided should actually be "durchsichtiger." I’ll keep the long hyphen indicating the break and add an underlined HR line for emphasis. Next, I’ll craft some minimal yet appealing CSS with a light parchment background and appropriate font styles. I must remember not to include any references to real people, as that’s not relevant here. Now, I'll produce the final HTML layout only.
