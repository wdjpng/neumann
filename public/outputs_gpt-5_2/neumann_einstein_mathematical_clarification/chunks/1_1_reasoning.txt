**Formatting HTML for handwriting**

I’m noticing that the top line of the screenshot seems partially cut, but the first line is still visible within the image boundaries. The line at the bottom looks fully visible too. It’s important to note that any following lines that are cut should be ignored. I need to craft HTML that replicates a handwriting style, using paragraphs and spans for formatting. I will incorporate MathJax for math expressions, aiming for a visually appealing monospaced or cursive style. I’ll stick to reliable parts without inventing uncertainties.
**Transcribing with uncertainties**

I need to take another careful look to transcribe this accurately. The text starts with, "en. Wenn s nicht in JΩ liegt, so seien p, g.” It could also be "so seien p, g mit.” The second line does indeed show "mit" to the left. After that, I see a line with a math equation, possibly saying "mit sps^{-1} = q, d. h. qsp = s." The next line mentions "gewählt (Hilfssatz 1.), dann ist," followed by "χ(rs) = χ(qsp) = - χ(s), χ(s) = 0." It seems clear, but the rest needs careful transcription.
**Refining transcription with HTML entities**

I’m considering using entity codes for the German umlauts—like “gewählt” as “gewÃhlt” and using HTML entity &auml;. Also, for "Hilfssatz," I’ll spell it consistently. In the image, "Hilfssatz 3" is underlined, and I want to replicate that, along with “Hilfssatz 1.)” for clarity.

Looking at the first line, it says, "en. Wenn s nicht in JΩ liegt, so seien p, g." I think “JΩ” might be “HΩ,” but I’ll stick with "JΩ" for now and use MathJax for the Greek Omega: Ω. I’ll italicize the variables to keep it clear. Line 2, I’ve confirmed it’s "mit."
**Transcribing mathematical lines**

Line 3 contains the equation: "sps^{-1} = q, d. h. qsp = s." I'll ensure "d. h." is formatted correctly as text within the math, using MathJax delimiters: \( ... \). 

For line 4, we see "gewählt (Hilfssatz 1.), dann ist," and I'm considering if "Hilfssatz" might be spelled with only one "s." However, since it's correctly underlined as "Hilfssatz 3," I’ll stick with that. 

Moving to line 5, I’ll keep the math as it's presented: "χ(rs) = χ(qsp) = -χ(s), χ(s) = 0." Line 6 has "w.z.b.w," which I’ll note as it is. 

For line 7, "Hilfssatz 3" is underlined, so I’ll present it as a header. And in line 8, I’m pondering whether it should really say "Für jede Gruppenwahl x ist."
**Creating the HTML structure**

I need to transcribe some math: I’m considering using symbols like \(\chi\) for certain variables instead of "x." For example, it might read "χ(rs) = χ(qsp) = -χ(s), χ(s) = 0." However, I want to ensure it looks visually appealing. 

I'll include a MathJax script for rendering and use a cursive font like Georgia to mimic handwritten notes. I’ll center the equations and keep separate lines using `div` elements for better organization. 

For specific expressions and details, such as underlining “Hilfssatz 3” and formatting the phrase "w.z.b.w." neatly, I’ll add appropriate HTML structure. 

Now, it’s time to finalize with correct indentations and HTML elements to keep everything organized and legible.
