**Analyzing image processing task**

I need to process an image of a handwritten math page and split it into 2 to 10 rectangular chunks. Each chunk should contain 2-4 lines of math without splitting expressions. I'm looking to maintain the whole line and prefer chunks to encompass the full width of the page. I'll need to provide pixel coordinates and the resolution, ensuring everything is in integers. The stated resolution of 1004x768 seems a bit confusing since typically the height should be 1004 and the width 768.
**Clarifying image dimensions**

I usually consider the first number as height and the second as width, but that isn't always the case. Here, in the pixel coordinate system, (0,0) is at the top-left of the image. The alt data indicates a resolution of 1004 for height and 768 for width, confirming that it’s in portrait orientation. For the chunks, I want to use the entire width of the letter page without any issues. I think I should set x1 at 40 and x2 at 728 to cover the text region effectively.
**Planning chunk divisions**

I need to include the whole width of the letter page in each chunk, even though that might mean including a gray border, which could be okay. However, I want to avoid splitting lines whenever possible; that always makes things easier. I'm planning to split vertically into chunks across the y-axis, aiming for 6-8 chunks with 2-4 lines of math each. Given the page has mostly German text with math, I can’t exceed 3-4 math lines per chunk. I’ll need to visually parse the lines, starting with the first one I can read.
**Parsing mathematical expressions**

I’m looking at the equation "x(S) = constant c(S)", which leads into the proof. There’s a long line following that, then another expression "x(s) = x(0) c c s = constant c(cs)". Next, the text discusses conditions for p and q that's somewhat challenging to decipher. I'm noting a line with "$ p^5 = q, thus q S p = s" and another stating "x(s) = x(9sp) = x(s1), x(s) = 0". It’s a lot to break down, especially as I move to the next section about "Hilfssatz 3." This might take a bit of time to organize.
**Organizing mathematical chunks**

I've got a long scribbled region at the bottom featuring a complex equation chain, so it's probably best to keep that in a separate chunk. I’m proposing to split things into 7 chunks:

Chunk 1: Covers the top lines and the equation "x(S)=constant c(S)" with y from 60 to around 170.  
Chunk 2: Includes proof text and the expression "x(s)=x(0) c cs …" with y from 160 to 330, covering a couple of math lines.  
Chunk 3: Contains lines with equations involving "$p^5= q …” and “x(s)=0,” with y from 320 to 460.  
Chunk 4: Features the heading "Hilfssatz 3." and equation "c × c = constant c" from 455 to 600.  
Chunk 5: Looks like it’s mostly text, sitting between y 595 to 720.  
Chunk 6: Covers "Hieraus folgt nun" with some math, around y 715 to 820.  
Finally, Chunk 7 holds the long expression chain at the bottom, extending downward, between y 810 to 950. This structure allows me to meet the requirements without overlapping or splitting equations chaotically.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I’m defining vertical boundaries to ensure each line is fully contained. I’ll overlap y ranges by about 10-20 pixels to avoid splitting slanted lines. Here's how I’ll set the y boundaries:

Chunk 1: y1=40, y2=200.  
Chunk 2: y1=180, y2=360.  
Chunk 3: y1=340, y2=500.  
Chunk 4: y1=490, y2=630.  
Chunk 5: y1=620, y2=740.  
Chunk 6: y1=730, y2=840.  
Chunk 7: y1=830, y2=1004.  

I’ll ensure the width is set to full image width with x1=0 and x2=768 for all chunks. The final coordinates for each rectangle along with the resolution will be:

(0, 40, 768, 200)  
(0, 180, 768, 360)  
(0, 340, 768, 500)  
(0, 490, 768, 630)  
(0, 620, 768, 740)  
(0, 730, 768, 840)  
(0, 830, 768, 1004)  
(768, 1004)
