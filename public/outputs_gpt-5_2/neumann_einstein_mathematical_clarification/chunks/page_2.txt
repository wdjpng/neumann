**Clarifying image resolution**

I'm trying to understand the image resolution notation. Typically "resolution 1004 768" means a height of 1004 pixels and a width of 768 pixels. However, earlier documents mentioned "look" cropping, and prior tasks used (width, height) as 768x1004. I want to be clear on orientation: the image seems to be in portrait mode, which suggests its width is likely 768 pixels and height 1004. We need to output that resolution as (768, 1004) while ensuring it covers the full width of the letter page when possible.
**Assessing page and image width**

I’m considering the page margins and how they relate to the scanned image. The image shows a background border, which is smaller than the full image area. While it's fine to include the entire image width, the instructions specify that I should include the whole width of each letter page. So I might set the left margin to around 60 pixels. To ensure I capture all the text lines, I’ll assume the width is 768 pixels. Next, I'll need to split the content into vertical chunks based on the page layout.
**Analyzing text lines and equations**

I'm looking at the lines and equations on the page. The first line near the top mentions something about “(p g a s? erfüllen wir die Zusatz...” around y coordinates 60 to 100. Then there's an equation: "x(S) = konstans . c(S)", followed by a line beginning with "Beweis:" and a few sentences. There's another equation: "x(S) = x(O . c c S) = konstans . c(S)". I see statements like "Wenn s nicht in P Q liegt" and what looks like "Hilfssatz 3." I need to break these down further.
**Defining chunk boundaries for equations**

I’m looking at the content of the page, which includes two to three lines followed by a statement like "Hieraus folgt nun I. c^2 = ...", along with some large scribbled sections. It's crucial that each chunk contains 2 to 4 lines of equations, so I'll create approximately 6 to 7 vertical chunks. The image height is 1004 pixels, with usable height around 930 pixels. I'll set boundaries for the chunks based on y positions, estimating the top border at y=35 and aiming to avoid cutting any lines.
**Finalizing chunk boundaries and resolution**

I need to finalize the chunks while ensuring they meet the guidelines. For chunk boundaries, I'll use \(x_1 = 0\) and \(x_2 = 767\) for the width. The image is 768 pixels wide and 1004 pixels high, so that makes the resolution (768, 1004). I’m aiming for no more than eight lines of text in each chunk, with overlaps of about 20 pixels. I've adjusted chunk three to extend to around \(y \approx 760\) to include important content. 

Here are the final outputs for the chunks:

(0, 0, 767, 360)  
(0, 340, 767, 600)  
(0, 580, 767, 760)  
(0, 730, 767, 880)  
(0, 860, 767, 1003)  
(768, 1004)
