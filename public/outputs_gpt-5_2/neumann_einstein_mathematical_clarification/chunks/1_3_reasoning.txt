**Analyzing mathematical notation**

I’m looking at the term "γ c," which seems to be lowercase gamma with a subscript. I notice there’s no multiplication dot, and the gamma appears again but with a bar. It might actually represent "I. c^2: gc." I’m also noting the differences between the shape of gamma and the letter "g," especially since "g" has a distinct loop tail. Since they want to render this using MathJax, I’ll proceed to craft a stylized HTML container.
**Formatting the HTML**

I plan to break lines using `<br>` tags. They mentioned to ignore the partially cut-off lines, which might be an underscore. I’ll focus on presenting the following text: 

"Hieraus folgt nun I. \(c^2 : \gamma c\), dann so wie bei Ihnen, also ist \(\gamma c\) charakteristische Einheit." I noticed it seems like "dann so wie bei Ihnen" might be missing a "wie." There’s also a macron over the "e" in Einheit, which does look like 'Eī,' but I'll keep it simple as "Einheit." I’ll create the HTML with basic CSS and include the MathJax script.
