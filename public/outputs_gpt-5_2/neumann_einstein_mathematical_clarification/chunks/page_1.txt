**Calculating chunk coordinates**

I need to output chunk coordinates for bounding boxes that contain 3-4 lines of equations from a handwritten letter with math expressions. So, I'll split it into chunks capturing text lines and equations. The instructions say to include the full width of each letter page. I’ll provide top-left and bottom-right coordinates in pixels and confirm the resolution. It looks like the resolution is 981x768, but I’m guessing the first number might be the height and the second is the width.
**Clarifying image dimensions**

I'm working with an image that could be 768x981. The instructions indicate to use the original image width and height. Typically, resolutions are written as width x height, and here it says resolution 981x768, suggesting height is 981 and width is 768. Since the page is vertical, that makes sense. I’ll need to output the dimensions as (width, height), so finally, I’ll format them as (768, 981) and then plan my chunks from there.
**Planning content chunks**

I see that the content has some elements like the top margin with "Hs. 91: 680" on the left and "Berlin, den 16.2.1928." on the right, which are text lines. The math equations begin a bit later. For the letter body, there's a large paragraph with about 8-10 lines. I want to keep chunks to around 8 lines, and math expressions should be limited to 2-4 lines. I'll start by creating Chunk 1 with the header lines at the top.
**Defining content chunks**

I'm planning to include the entire width of the full page to capture everything. For Chunk 2, it covers the first paragraph starting with "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" with a height of about 140 to 380. I'll also want to use the full width for this. Chunk 3 will handle lines referencing page numbers and equations, like "Auf s. 130, §52, erweisen Sie..." leading up to the equation line with sigma. I’ll create additional chunks for subsequent text lines, Hilfssatz lines, and equations. I need to examine the placements closely, though!
**Determining chunk coordinates**

I’m taking a detailed look at the content to define coordinates for each chunk. For example, I see two mathematical lines, and I want to ensure they're captured correctly. 

Chunk 1 will be for the header, set at (0, 0, 767, 120). Chunk 2 will cover the first paragraph from (0, 120, 767, 420). For chunk 3, I’m including the lines with equations from (0, 410, 767, 580). Chunk 4 contains additional text lines set from (0, 560, 767, 720), and chunk 5 captures Hilfssatz lines and equations at (0, 700, 767, 980). The final resolution is (768, 981).
