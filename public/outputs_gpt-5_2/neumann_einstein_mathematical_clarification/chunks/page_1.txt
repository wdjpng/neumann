**Evaluating image cropping**

I need to split a handwritten letter image with some math expressions into rectangles for cropping. The image resolution appears to be 981x768, but it looks like the orientation suggests it's rotated. I’m checking whether the width is 768 and the height is 981. Since this looks like a portrait orientation, I want to confirm these dimensions before outputting the coordinates for cropping. I'll have to provide 2-10 rectangles based on that.
**Planning chunk layout**

I need to create chunks of the letter page that include almost the full width, so I'll make vertical slices from the left to the right margin. Each chunk should contain 3-4 lines of equations at most. There are some complex math expressions, which can be challenging to parse. Primarily, I see German text interspersed with equations. I think grouping each chunk to contain 6-8 text lines and a maximum of 2-3 math lines makes sense, ensuring no lines get split by including overlaps.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I’m planning to set the boundaries for each rectangle to include some margin for slanted lines, so I’ll overlap them slightly. I’ll estimate the Y coordinates based on the image dimensions of 981. The top margin has some small text that appears as a header, which I'll include in the first chunk. I aim to create 6 or 7 chunks overall. My approach will involve determining the Y ranges for groups of lines and setting the X coordinates to cover the entire width of the letter page, from x1=0 to x2=768.
**Mapping line positions**

I need to ensure the letter page area is included properly. They mentioned to incorporate the entire width of each letter page in each chunk, which I can work with. I’ll approximate the Y positions of the lines to create 6 chunks. The top area has “Berlin den 16.3.1928.” around y  20-50 and “Hs. 91: 680” around y  57. I’m considering having 7-8 chunks with overlaps to make sure I capture every line effectively, especially the main text that begins near y  130.
**Defining chunk specifications**

I need to ensure that each chunk of the letter page adheres to the requirement of having no more than 8 lines of text and a limited number of math lines. The math-heavy lines seem to be around y  480-620, featuring lines like the sigma equations. 

I’m proposing 6 chunks, carefully separating text and equations. For example, Chunk 1 captures header lines and initial text, while Chunk 3 focuses on equation lines. I’ll set the coordinates to ensure full capture without splits, establishing overlaps between chunks for assurance. The Y coordinates will be adjusted within the height of 981, and I’ll aim for the full width from x1=0 to x2=768. Overall, I plan to validate that the organization meets the intended guidelines.
**Preparing output coordinates**

I’m ready to produce the output as a list of coordinates formatted like "(x1, y1, x2, y2)" with integers. I’ll make sure the final line states "(768, 981)" for clarity. I want to double-check that the header, "Berlin 16.3.1928," which is near y  35, is indeed included in Chunk 1. Once I confirm this, I’ll proceed to deliver the output.
