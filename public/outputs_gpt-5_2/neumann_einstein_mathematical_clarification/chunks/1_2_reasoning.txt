**Transcribing text from image**

I need to transcribe text from an image to HTML while preserving its formatting, especially for mathematical content using MathJax. The image has handwritten German, and I should avoid lines that are cut off. I notice the top line might be cut, so I should ignore that. The visible line "C × C = Konstans C" could be a variation on "Konstanten" or "konstant." I'm trying to decipher the handwriting carefully to maintain accuracy.
**Analyzing letters from text**

I'm analyzing the text from the image. After the “=“, I see “Konskons? c”, but I think “C × C = konstans. C” makes more sense, especially if the dot is a period. However, "Konstans" isn't German. Looking at the second line, I see "Beweis: Denn mit C genügt offenbar." The next line mentions "auch C × C der Bedingung in Hilfssatz 2." There are underlines in the text, and the first line seems cut off. I'll need to ignore that part.
**Transcribing visible lines**

I realize we need to ignore any lines that are partially cut off, focusing on fully visible lines. Starting with "C × C = Konstans. C," I’m questioning if it’s clear. The first line seems incomplete with "= ...". I think it might actually be "C × C = konstant: C," which makes more sense with a colon. I’m considering how mathematics usually presents this; perhaps it's "C x C = konstant: C" or might they mean "C × C = konstans C"? I’ll need to clarify that.
**Transcribing mathematical text**

I can use MathJax to transcribe the math as \(C \times C = ...\).

Next, I see lines like "Beweis: Denn mit C genügt offenbar" and "auch C × C der Bedingung in Hilfssatz 2." I think I can underline "Beweis:" using CSS and style it to mimic handwriting; maybe a font like Georgia, Times New Roman, or even Papyrus could work. I’d want to use a serif font, set proper spacing, and perhaps a parchment background. I’ll have to stick to visible lines, including "C × C = konstant: C," but the exact word choice seems uncertain.
**Preparing HTML output**

I’m finalizing the HTML transcription using MathJax for the math expressions like \(C \times C = ...\). I’m confused about some text, possibly “Konstans. C” or “konstans: c.” I need to ensure that the first line matches what I see and includes the correct capitalization.

I'll create a styled container with a parchment background, incorporating lines like:  
1. \(C \times C = \text{konstans. } C\)  
2. An underlined "Beweis:" with appropriate CSS.  
3. The additional lines from the image with correct spacing.

I’ll make sure to include umlauts and a subtle ink color for aesthetics. On the final touches, I’d like to ensure that every detail is aligned as accurately as possible!
