**Transcribing German text**

I need to transcribe the text from the image into HTML, ensuring I keep the formatting and line breaks while ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The image has handwritten German math text. The very top seems partially cut off, but there’s some visible text—something like "(p, ganz p b...??) genügen nur die Gruppen-zahlen". 

Zooming in mentally, it seems the first line starts with "(p, ganz p von Z?)". It continues with "genügen nur die Gruppen-" and the next line has "zahlen". I'm piecing this together!

The second line appears to say "x(S) = konstans. (cS)," but it might actually be "konstant (cS)". The handwriting shows “konstans” spelled with an 's', which is curious. 

The third line starts with "Beweis:" followed by "Die Notwendigkeit ist klar. Die" and then "Hinreichendheit zeigt man so: genügt x'(S) der". I’m questioning the spelling of "Hinreichendheit." It appears twice, yet I'm unsure if there's a common spelling involved. Moving on, the next part seems to say "P Z sofort," possibly referencing "P, Z". The final line describes "x(S) = x(O) · C(S) = konstans. (cS)". It looks like I’m piecing this together well!
**Analyzing bottom text**

The last line appears to start with "ein. Wenn s nicht in PZD liegt, so seien p, q". I'm noting that the bottom lines might be partially cut off, so I'll need to be cautious. The instruction tells me to ignore partially cut-off lines from the screenshot, which means I might exclude this one. 

However, the last line seems visible but is followed by something that's possibly cut off. Going back to the top two lines, they appear light gray and could be questionable if they’re partially cut off. It’s a bit tricky!
**Preparing math transcription**

I see there's a scribble at the far left that could be partial parentheses. I’ll need to use MathJax to render the math expressions properly, wrapping them like \(x(S)=\text{konstans}\, (cS)\). 

The goal is to keep the formatting simple but elegant, aiming for a transcription that feels polished. I’ll use a <div class="page"> with CSS for fonts and structure, and <p> lines with <br> for breaks. 

For the content, I’ll start with Line 1: "(p, ganz p von Z)" which feels ambiguous—could it also be "(p, ganz p von Z?)" or even "(p, ganz p von ZQ)"? I'm figuring this out!
**Finalizing math transcription**

I’m focusing on presenting the equation "x(S) = konstans. (cS)" clearly, though I’ll stick with "konstans." since that's how it's spelled. It seems better to keep it as a separate line. 

The lines read: "Beweis: Die Notwendigkeit ist klar. Die Hinreichendheit zeigt man so: genügt x'(S) der Bedingung, dann sieht man für die von P Ω sofort." For clarity, I’ll arrange it in a way that looks nice.

The last portion shows "ein. Wenn s nicht in PΩ liegt, so seien p, q", and while I'm uncertain about final letters, I’ll accurately transcribe based on what’s visible. I'll use elegant styling for the final HTML, ensuring everything is clear and visually appealing!
