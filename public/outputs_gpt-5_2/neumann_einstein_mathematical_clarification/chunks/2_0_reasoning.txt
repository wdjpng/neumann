**Creating HTML with MathJax**

I need to produce HTML that includes math using MathJax. The visible text should include "II. Aus" followed by the equations and then "folgt." I want to make sure we craft a styled header with "II." underlined and "Aus" in italic or script style. The equations need to be typeset properly. I’m not sure if the first character should be 'zc' or 'fc', so I’ll need to clarify that as I go!
**Determining Variable Representation**

I'm analyzing how to accurately represent the variable in the text. The expression starts with "f c," but I’m concerned about possible transcription errors. Perhaps marking an unknown character with "?" could help? However, I want to avoid guessing and ensure full transcription. The variable could either be "zc" or "fc," but I need to respect what's visually there. I see that the next line begins with "fc = a + b." None of the lines appear to be cut off, so I should stick with "fc."
**Transcribing Equations Carefully**

I'm deciding on the right way to choose my equations, like "c = a + b, a^2 = a, b^2 = b, ab = ba = 0." I want to remove the leading character to avoid errors, but I mustn’t omit any text. The third line has "folgt" alone, and I think I should transcribe that without additional equations since the bottom isn't fully visible. Wait, some equations appear after "folgt," but they might be cut off. The crops on the right side mean we might be dealing with partially cut off lines, so I need to be careful here.
**Deciding on Visible Lines**

The line "folgt ..." extends beyond what we can see, so we need to ignore it since it's partially cut off. It's clear that the third line continues to the right, indicating it's not fully visible. The cropping means we should skip that line altogether. Looking at the bottom, I see a line below "folgt" that isn't visible, but we can include the two lines: "II. Aus" and "c = a + b, a^2 = a, b^2 = b, ab = ba = 0." It seems that line is fully visible after all.
**Crafting the HTML with MathJax**

I'm going to create HTML that includes the MathJax script to show equations properly. I want to style things with a parchment background and use fonts that give a nice appeal while keeping the original feel. I’ll set up the header with "II." underlined and "Aus" in italics, ensuring it has a left margin for indentation.

So, I’ll implement the structure like this:

```html
<div class="page">
  <div class="section">
    <div class="line">
      <span class="roman">II.</span>
      <span class="word">Aus</span>
    </div>
    <div class="line eq">
      <span class="math">\(c=a+b,\quad a^2=a,\quad b^2=b,\quad ab=ba=0\)</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

I’ll also add the MathJax script to handle the mathematical expressions correctly. It's important to ensure everything looks nice and preserves the line breaks as needed!
