**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to provide an HTML transcription of the handwritten text in the image, while ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The snippet shows an oval around some German text and math, but the handwriting looks tough. I must transcribe as faithfully as possible, even though I'm uncertain. The instruction is to use MathJax for any mathematical expressions and keep formatting close with proper line breaks. I've spotted German words, possibly starting with "Wäre nicht primitiv, so wäre ...," but it’s challenging to discern everything.
**Deciphering the text**

As I focus on the text within the oval, I see the roman numeral "II" first. It looks like "Wäre e−c" or maybe "Wäre e^c"? Continuing, I think it's "c e = c1 + c2," or it could be something like "ℓ^e e = c1 + c2." There are also terms like "c^2 = c?" that are hard to decipher, with other scribbles crossing out areas. Since the instructions say to ignore partially cut-off lines, I should only transcribe what's inside the oval, but it's still quite ambiguous.
**Transcribing potential text**

I'm attempting to interpret the text as "II Wäre e−c nicht primitiv, so wäre c = c1 + c2, c^2 = c2?" or perhaps it's "Ist wörtlich nicht primitiv?" It might be related to math concepts about "primitive" fields or polynomials. I wonder if marking unreadable parts with square brackets would work since I can't add commentary. The instructions specify not to fill in gaps but to use spans labeled "illegible" or ellipses. I should closely approximate the shapes and scribbles while adhering to the transcription guidelines.
**Analyzing the transcription**

On the left, I see the superscript "II" and "Wäre," which indeed starts with an umlaut 'ä'. The following bits might be "e-c" or "e^c," perhaps scribbled as 'e^-'? Then, I read "nicht primitiv, so wäre," followed by a formula with parentheses and an equals sign. I could structure it as "II Wäre e^{-c} nicht primitiv, so wäre c = c_1 + c_2, (c^2 = c_2?), ... = 0." However, I should represent unknown portions as [unleserlich]. While the instructions call for HTML only, I can still indicate unreadable parts. I’ll use a bordered rounded container for the header style and a script font for the text lines.
**Creating the transcription**

I'm working on structuring my transcription like this: "II Wäre e^(-c) nicht primitiv, so wäre c = c_1 + c_2, (c^2 = c_2?)." I realize it's best to provide a near-verbatim version, replacing unknown parts with "[...]" to avoid misrepresenting specifics. The layout might include a just-readable line for the text and math, focusing on the clearer parts like "c = c1 + c2" and "= 0." I plan to include the MathJax CDN script in a styled container that mimics an oval with borders. I'll create relevant classes for the text and math, ensuring line breaks are preserved.
