**Interpreting text formatting**

I see there’s a curved line above "Ich" and a long horizontal line preceding it. I wonder if this could be interpreted as a long underscore. Since the instruction emphasizes keeping formatting close, I think we could use blockquote or a handwriting-style font in CSS. Maybe I should represent lines in italics and a greyish pencil-like appearance. We’ll focus on three specific lines while ignoring partially cut-off ones. I’ll avoid heavy formatting limitations but take care to enhance its visual appeal.
**Creating a styled HTML fragment**

I notice there might be a long dash above the first line, which we can include as a flourish like an em dash or underscore. The task requires an HTML output without backticks, and the user wanted MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions, even though there aren’t any. I’m not sure if including the script is necessary, but it can’t hurt. It's essential to correctly style the text to make it look handwritten. I need to ensure the German umlaut "ü" in "Grüssen" is included correctly, as well as knowing that "Grüssen" plural ends with "ssen."
**Crafting the HTML snippet**

I need to ensure that "ü" is indicated properly with quotes above the "u." The spelling should be "Grüssen," not "Grüßen," as the image shows it clearly. It's evident that "Ich verbleibe" is also included, along with "J. v. Neumann," which will have a period at the end. I'm thinking of adding a small decorative flourish above the first line, maybe a centered em dash. I'll craft the HTML to wrap everything in a centered card with a light parchment background, reflecting the image's light beige color.
**Setting up the HTML and CSS**

I’ll style the container appropriately. While I might consider using a script to load MathJax, it may not be necessary here. For the fonts, I’ll aim for a cursive style like "Homemade Apple" or "Patrick Hand," but if those aren’t available, I’ll fallback to alternatives like "Brush Script MT," "Segoe Script," or "Lucida Handwriting." 

I want to format the text with line breaks and include a thin, decorative horizontal line that’s perhaps 60% width and slightly tilted. 

I'll add a bit of left indent for the second line and adjust spacing accordingly. Here’s the basic HTML structure I’ll produce with the required CSS.
**Finalizing HTML and CSS**

I need to completely ignore any lines of text that are partially cut off from the screenshot since they aren't relevant. I'm focusing solely on creating the HTML code with minimal commentary. For the CSS, I plan to set the width of the paper to around 900 pixels with a background color of #efe7d0, which resembles "old paper." 

I’m considering adding a texture, but it’s probably not necessary. The ink color will be a grey (#7a848a) to mimic pencil, and I’ll opt for a cursive font style. 

I’ll include a decorative flourish styled as a short line, centered above the first line, with a width of 200 pixels, a border-top, and a slight rotation. Space will be adjusted with proper line height. Time to produce the final HTML!
