**Clarifying math notation**

I’m thinking we can include CSS for letter style. The math notation term "∑_p" converts to \sum_{p}. There’s some ambiguity with terms like c(cspt), but I’ll convert it to \sum_{p} c(cspt) \ge c(cs) \sum_{p} c(pts) and ensure it’s inside \[ ... \]. I wonder if "pts" should actually be "p t s." I’ll avoid including any partially cut-off lines, just sticking to what's visible above. The second line has "weisen" that I'd like to clarify too.
**Preparing HTML code**

I realized it should indeed be "weisen Sie den Frobenius-" for the correct accusative. I’ll keep the hyphen at the end of the line by splitting "Frobenius-" appropriately. In the HTML code, I'll use a manual `<br>` after "Frobenius-" to ensure proper spacing. 

For the HTML structure, I’ll add the head section with meta tags, CSS fonts like serif for margin and container width, plus the MathJax script. The body will include a container and use `<p>` with `<br>` for line breaks. I also want to style the text in a handwriting-like font, possibly using 'Caveat' or 'Patrick Hand,' while ensuring a fallback to a cursive font.
**Creating formatted HTML**

I can definitely make the design visually appealing by adding a subtle lined paper background color (#f3ebd5) without going overboard. For the HTML structure, I’ll start with a `<body>` tag and include a `<div class="letter">`. I decided to place text lines inside `<div class="line">`, but using `<pre>` could help preserve the formatting, as MathJax can parse the math notation inline. 

To keep line breaks, I might prefer using `<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">` within the div. Since using `<pre>` can degrade font quality, I’m leaning towards using `<div class="letter-body">` with a `<span>` for lines instead. I’ll include the example text for proper formatting.
**Finalizing HTML structure**

I’m wrapping up the HTML with the supporting line “den weiteren Hilfssatz.” In my equation, I’ll ensure it’s displayed properly: \[ \sum_{p} c(cspt) \ge c(cs) \sum_{p} c(pts) \]. 

I noticed that the second line starts with "schen" and has a leading space due to hyphenation, so I can include an indent of about 1em. For spacing after "§," I’ll use a narrow non-breaking space, like &thinsp; or &nbsp; to place the "§ 52" correctly. It's important to completely ignore any lines of text that are partially cut off from the screenshot, as the left margin is missing some characters. I'll produce the final HTML accordingly, and while a header might be nice, it’s not strictly necessary.
**Adding CSS for styling**

I need to make sure everything looks good, so I’ll add some CSS for styling. The body background color will be a light ivory, and I'll create a container with a paper-like drop-shadow. 

For the font, I’ll use a handwriting style and add a generic fallback to 'Georgia' if needed. Linking to Google fonts, I'll include 'Caveat' and 'Patrick Hand' while using an `<link>` tag. 

I’ll ensure to produce the HTML code with the text displayed exactly: 

Line 1: "Auf S.&nbsp;130, §&nbsp;52, weisen Sie den Frobenius-"  
Line 2: "schen Hilfssatz über die Elemente von Z&beta;, und"  
Line 3: "dann auf S. 131 den weiteren Hilfssatz." 

I’ll also ensure the Greek beta is correctly represented as "Z&beta;".
