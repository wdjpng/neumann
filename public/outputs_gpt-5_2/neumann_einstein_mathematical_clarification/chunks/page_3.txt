**Resolving image dimensions**

There’s some confusion surrounding the resolution being 986x768. It seems that 986 refers to the height while 768 refers to the width. The display dimensions suggest cropping instructions pointing the same way. So, if the original image is 986x768 and it’s a portrait format, I need to confirm that width is 768 and height is 986. Ultimately, I’ll need to conclude with the dimensions formatted as (768, 986). Now I can decide how to break this down further.
**Chunking equations for clarity**

I’m considering how to split the top portion of the equations into two manageable chunks. The first line has "fc = a + b, a^2 = a, b^2 = b, ab = ba = 0," which seems like a dense expression. After that, there’s a derivation starting with "a = (a+b)a (a+b) = ... = constant fc." This section also features two or three lines of math with crossouts, followed by other informative text. I need to ensure that no chunk contains more than 3-4 lines of equations.
**Organizing content into chunks**

I can split the top area into two chunks: the first will cover the header and the first equation, while the second will include the following equation lines and the "Daher ..." text. I want to ensure that each chunk contains a maximum of 3-4 lines of equations. Then, for the next section, there's a paragraph starting with "Ich glaube dass diese Methode der viel mehr rechnerischen Problemlösungen..." which can be grouped into one chunk not exceeding eight lines. Lastly, the closing lines, including the signature, will form another chunk. Overall, I’ll likely have four chunks: header + first equation, second equation derivations, the paragraph, and the closing.
**Choosing bounding box coordinates**

I need to pick bounding box coordinates that fully contain all the lines. Given the slant, I might need to adjust the height and width as well. Let’s estimate: for the left margin, I’m thinking x  50, with a blank width of about 40 px. The writing seems to begin at x  110. I should aim to include the whole width of the letter page. So, I can set x1 to 0 or close to it, and x2 to 767, ensuring all lines are captured along with some additional white margin, which that’s acceptable.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I’m determining the bounding box coordinates for each chunk to ensure lines aren't split. I want to set y-coordinate boundaries that enclose lines effectively. I estimate starting the first chunk at y1=0 and y2=280 to include the header, "II. Also," and the first math expression, ensuring we don’t crop anything. 

For the second chunk, covering the derivation lines and "Daher ..." text, I'll set y1=250 and y2=480. The third chunk will be from y1=470 to y2=760 for the paragraph, and the fourth will range from y1=730 to y2=985 for closing lines. Overall, this setup keeps the necessary overlaps to capture every part.
**Formatting output for chunks**

I'm preparing to format the output for each chunk as requested. Each chunk will be represented on its own line in the format "(x1, y1, x2, y2)". Finally, I'll add the line "(768, 986)" for resolution. I need to ensure there's no extra commentary in the output. So now, I’m ready to deliver just the coordinates clearly and concisely as specified.
