**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe all text from an image into HTML while maintaining the formatting as closely as possible, including line breaks. The image appears to be handwritten German, which I’ll need to read carefully. 

I’m seeing the line, "Kann ich die Theorie der Normalität und," and another part might be, "Abständsbarkeit im U..." I’ll focus on deciphering this German cursive carefully, ensuring I interpret each line accurately from the image.
**Deciphering German text**

I'm continuing to read through the handwritten German text. I think "und Abzählbarkeit" fits with the context since "Abzählbarkeit" means countability in mathematics. This connects well with "Kann ich die Theorie der Normalität und Abzählbarkeit im U unbeschränkt..."

For the second line, it looks like "Abzählbarkeit im U unbeschränkt" could be correct, with a possible typo interpreting "unbeschränkt" as "unbeschränktet." At the end of the second line, I'm spotting "einfach durchführen." 

Moving to line three, it begins with "Ferner: wenn" and continues with "ich eine Menge von Herm. Op. ist, ob alle..." I’ll go step by step as I transcribe.
**Transcribing with care**

I notice some editing scribbles, particularly the word "die" that seems overwritten. Now, looking closely at the second line, "Abzählbarkeit im U unbeschränktet" might not be correct, and accuracy is key here. The instructions tell me to fully transcribe and ignore any partially cut-off lines, but everything seems visible.

As I examine it closely, I see that at the end of line one, "Normalität und" ends with an "a" that possibly begins "Abzählbarkeit." There seems to be a small cross-out near "ab," which suggests some corrections. It’s important not to guess too much as I go through this.
**Transcribing text accurately**

I need to keep the formatting while transcribing the text, and perhaps showing the strikethroughs isn't necessary, but I might include them if it adds to clarity. The user requested a "pretty" format, but since there isn't a header here, I can just use <p> with <br>. They mentioned using MathJax for mathematical expressions, but there aren’t any in this text.

Moving on to line three, it starts with "Ferner: wenn" and continues "ich eine Menge von Herm. Op. ist, ob alle." The grammar seems off, and I might need to consider "ich eine Menge von Herm. Op. habe, ob alle" instead. I realize "Herm. Op." likely stands for "Hermitian Operators." I'll proceed with caution as I transcribe.
**Transcribing and formatting carefully**

Let’s focus on the phrase: "Ferner: wenn ich eine Menge von Herm. Op. habe, ob alle..." It seems I need to adjust how I read it; maybe it should be “ist, die alle” instead of "ist, ob alle.” This phrase appears to hint at the relationship with Hermitian Operators, but I need to be cautious about accuracy.

As I finalize the transcription, I plan to format it in HTML as requested. The formatting will include subtle CSS for a more visually appealing presentation, along with the right fonts. I'll make sure to preserve all line breaks and create a clean, legible output, including the necessary MathJax script as instructed.
**Finalizing the transcription**

I’m restructuring the lines for clarity. Line 1 reads: "Kann ich die Theorie der Normalität und." Then, for Line 2, I have "Abzählbarkeit im Unbeschränkten einfach durchführen. Ferner: wenn." 

For Line 3, I'll go with "ich eine Menge von Herm. Op. habe," since that fits better grammatically. Line 4 will say: "Herm. Op. umfaßt, die mit jedem Element" and Line 5 will conclude with "von A vert. sind, ob 'dasselbe' für all."

I'll finalize the transcription into a single HTML block and include a subtle header, even if there wasn’t one originally.
