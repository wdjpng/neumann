**Creating HTML layout**

I’m thinking of designing a simple HTML page with large padding and a right-aligned signature line. It might be best to place the signature slightly left of center, in a cursive font with some top margin added. Since the rest of the page is blank, I’ll include a newline break. The instruction says to use MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions. Even if there aren't any, I can include the MathJax script since they requested HTML only.
**Producing HTML transcription**

I’m putting together a simple HTML transcription document. I’ve set the background color and font styles for the body and the signature. The signature will read "J. v. Neumann," in a cursive font and be right-aligned. I also noticed there are left and right grey borders from the scanner in the image, but I’ll ignore those. I’ll keep it minimal and focus only on the necessary transcription, avoiding partially cut-off text. I'll ensure I don’t identify real people in images.
