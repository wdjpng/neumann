**Formatting considerations for the app**

The app might not support heavy formatting, but HTML should be fine. I’m thinking we could present the text lines inside a centered, narrow container with a line height that mimics handwriting. The background could be a parchment color like #f5e6cc, but that may not be critical—just trying to "make it pretty." 

For the font, I suggest using something like Georgia or Times New Roman. I'll ensure we maintain line breaks with `<br>`. Also, I need to pay attention to punctuation, making sure that quotes are correctly placed.
**Formatting the text accurately**

Replicating the quotes accurately is important, but we can still make it visually appealing. The instruction is to keep formatting as close to the original as possible, so I'll stick with straight quotes instead of switching to German quotes.

I’ll adjust the text to show “beweisen ist”, bzw. Welche Annahmen, keeping “Welche” capitalized as it appears. It’s also important to clear any stray characters, like the caret cross. 

The next lines include "für seine Gültigkeit charakteristisch" and "sind. Es gelingt insbesondere das quan-", with attention to hyphens. I’ll present the subsequent lines with their respective adjustments and correct punctuation.
**Clarifying quote usage**

The writer had quotes around "geforderten," and I see that the image confirms this. However, I'm hesitant to use quotes there again and will instead include them after "heitsrelationen" with a closing parenthesis after "geforderten."

Accuracy is crucial, especially since I need to fully transcribe the text from the image to minimize misreads. After closely examining line 6, it looks like there are indeed quotes around "geforderten." So I’ll generate the line as:

"heitsrelationen" "geforderten") anzugeben.  

But I have to be cautious—having two consecutive quotes feels unnatural. I'll need to make sure it reads smoothly while being accurate.
**Finalizing HTML and CSS**

I’ll be approximating the final line as: "heitsrelationen" geforderten) anzugeben. — with a long dash at the end. It's good to keep the hyphen from the previous line "Gibbs-". 

Now I'll create the CSS to mimic the letter format with a narrow container and maybe italic text. I plan to set the font to "Times New Roman" and ensure the white space preserves line breaks. While I won’t need to explicitly add `<br>` tags, it’s safer to include them.

They’ve asked to completely ignore any partially cut-off lines from the screenshot—none of which are present here. I'll also wrap each line in `<p class="line">` or use a simpler method with `<div>` for easy formatting. Finally, I'll prepare everything for output.
