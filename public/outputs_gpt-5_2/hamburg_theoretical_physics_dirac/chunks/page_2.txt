**Splitting the letter image**

I need to split this image of a handwritten German letter into chunks. Since it's text paragraphs without mathematical expressions, I want to include the full width of each letter page while keeping it reasonable. The instruction limits eight lines of text per chunk, and since there are many lines, I could create four chunks. I need to include some overlaps between chunks to ensure all lines are fully contained, maybe around 15-20 pixels. The visible resolution appears to be 1009x768.
**Confirming image resolution**

The resolution is given as 1009 by 768, which typically indicates width 1009 and height 768. However, the image appears to be portrait-oriented, suggesting the height is greater than the width. This means it’s likely that the width is actually 768 and the height is 1009. The cropping coordinates mentioned confirm this as well. In portrait orientation, the height is indeed greater than the width, so I’m concluding that the width is 768 and the height is 1009.
**Determining chunk coordinates**

I’ll set the width to 768 and the height to 1009 for the image. I need to define chunk coordinates covering the full width, meaning x1 will start at 0, and I want to include the full width of the page, so x2 will be 767. The y-coordinates will range from 0 to 1008. Next, I need to count the number of text lines — it looks like there are about 18-20 lines. There might be some faint scribbles at the top, but I see some text like "hingegen im Sinne der Fern parallel..." starting a bullet list.
**Counting text lines**

Let’s count the approximate number of lines in the text. Starting from the very faint pre-line at the top, "hingegen im Sinne der Fernparallel..." counts as the first line. Then I see a series of bullet points: 
- The second line is "- Theorie ..."
- The third is "- Feldgl ...", and so on.

I count up to around 19 lines, with a possible continuation beyond the last visible line. There are a few pauses, but the overall structure looks clear with solid text, so this should work for chunking!
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I've determined that the image has about 23 lines. To meet the requirements, I want to split it into four chunks to keep lines under 8 per chunk, while also accounting for overlaps. I've refined the height boundaries to ensure coverage and prevent any line from being split across chunks. 

The final coordinates for the chunks will be:
Chunk 1: (0, 0, 767, 300)
Chunk 2: (0, 240, 767, 560)
Chunk 3: (0, 500, 767, 820)
Chunk 4: (0, 760, 767, 1008)

These should capture all lines fully while following the constraints!
