**Transcribing the equation**

I need to transcribe text from an image to HTML, using MathJax for any math elements. The image shows a handwritten equation: 

( Σ_μ γ_μ ( p_μ + e/c φ_μ ) + m c i ) ψ = 0.

I see a summation symbol Σ with a subscript μ. It looks like there’s also γ_μ following it. I'm trying to ensure accuracy as I interpret terms like p_μ and whether "φ_μ" or "A_μ" should be used. I’ll make sure to capture this correctly for the final HTML format!
**Inspecting the equation details**

I’m not sure if the symbol is "φ_μ" or "A_μ." The image shows a circle with a vertical line that resembles curly phi, but considering the Dirac equation, "A_μ" usually represents the gauge potential. There’s also "+ mc i" inside the brackets, with "i" appearing after "mc." The typical Dirac equation format is "(Σ γ^μ (p_μ + e/c A_μ) + mc) ψ = 0." I need to focus on accurately transcribing what I see rather than making physics assumptions.
**Transcribing with precision**

I clearly see "+ mc i" in the handwritten text; I'm considering whether to include 'i'. The summation symbol "Σ" has a subscript that looks like "μ," which supports my idea that it’s Σ_μ. The small "m" underneath has a tail, resembling mu. I can express this in MathJax as:

\( \left( \sum_{\mu} \gamma_{\mu} \left( p_{\mu} + \frac{e}{c}\,\phi_{\mu} \right) + mc i \right) \psi = 0 \).

I'm leaning towards φ because the symbol looks like it could be phi. Greek letters can be tricky, but I’ll keep it accurate!
**Preparing to transcribe the letter**

I need to focus on transcribing the full text from the image while ignoring any cut-off sections. The user specifically mentioned they want the text transcribed into HTML and formatted closely to the original, including line breaks. I'll use MathJax for mathematical display and focus on making it visually appealing. 

Without needing backticks, I'll include a minimal HTML snippet with the MathJax CDN. I think a centered, large display with a serif font will work well to make it pretty!
**Creating the HTML document**

I’m setting out to create a minimal HTML document that loads MathJax for displaying the equation in prominence. I’ll ensure it’s centered and enlarged, while also keeping line breaks from the original format. 

Since there's no sensitive info, I can proceed confidently. I'll include the MathJax script in the head and style the background to resemble parchment. The equation will be enclosed in a container with a beige background for that nice, paper-like finish. 

I'll format the equation using φ and ensure it looks clean and appealing!
