**Creating handwritten style HTML**

I’m planning to create an HTML snippet that mimics a handwritten style using a cursive font. The user wants it formatted closely to their request, so I'll use CSS to set a beige background and adjust margins and line-height. I can choose from fonts like "Segoe Script," or "Lucida Handwriting," which are available offline. While the user asked about MathJax for mathematical expressions, it seems unnecessary since none are required. I'll keep it simple yet elegant!
**Formatting HTML with special characters**

I need to ensure that characters like German umlauts and 'ß' are included, using examples like 'hätte' and 'zurückzu-'. Hyphen line breaks must be preserved, and I won't add any disclaimers—just straight HTML code. I'm thinking of using a `<div class="letter">` container and deciding between `<pre>` or styled lines. Since I want to preserve spacing, I'll go with `<p>` tags combined with `<br>` for line breaks, setting 'white-space: pre-wrap;'. Finally, I’ll make sure the text is left-aligned instead of centered.
**Ensuring text quality for HTML**

I want to maintain the text quality for the German passage. It reads: "Ich habe mich für den Sommer nach Hamburg beurlauben lassen, um im Winter nach Berlin zurückzu- gehen. Nach Schwiers Abgang nach Rostock, hätte ich mit dem Professor- titel leichter kommen können, kommt." 

I need to double-check punctuation, ensuring commas and periods are placed correctly. Hyphenated breaks like 'zurückzu-' and 'Professor-' must stay intact. Plus, since they asked to ignore partially cut-off lines, I’ll skip the first top line. Now, let's create the HTML with the appropriate styling!
