**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe handwritten German text from the provided image into HTML. I’ll keep the formatting with line breaks and ignore lines that are cut off. Since there’s no header, I’ll focus on creating a styled body, possibly using a handwritten-style font through CSS. The main goal is to ensure accuracy in the transcription while making it visually appealing. I'll carefully read the visible lines, focusing on the central section of the page.
**Examining visible lines**

I need to be careful about identifying which lines in the image are partially cut off. The instruction is clear: I must ignore any lines that are cut. It looks like the top line is nearly cut in half, which means I can't rely on it. I see that the bottom line is also partially cut. So, I have to focus only on lines that are fully visible to ensure an accurate transcription. Let's keep examining those lines!
**Analyzing line visibility**

I'm evaluating the lines in the image to see if they are fully visible or partially cut. The text appears intact, but I notice margins that have blank spaces, especially on the left. The top might show some ascenders cut, but it also seems like there's sufficient space for the first line. However, I have concerns about the right edge. The last visible line, "benutzen ist 'von welchen Annahmen'?" might be cut at the bottom. I need to double-check everything!
**Transcribing German cursive**

I’m diving into the task of transcribing the handwritten German cursive text. The top line begins with something like "von di vert. sind, dt 'dasselbe," but I'm not entirely sure. It might actually be "von d. vert. sind, daß 'dasselbe für di.'" I really need to parse it carefully to get it right. The second line seems to start with "— dann besteht die 'genau aus den." I’ll zoom in on the characters and piece it all together! Accuracy is crucial here.
**Crafting HTML transcription**

I'm getting ready to create an HTML transcription of the handwritten text. The content seems to start with "von welchen Annahmen," and I need to ensure the punctuation is accurate, especially with quotes. I’ll replicate the format with line breaks and indentation, maybe adding some italics.

For the HTML structure, I'll style it with a cursive font and a parchment-like background. I need to maintain visibility and respect the instruction to ignore partially cut lines, so I’ll focus on the second line and beyond. Let's also carefully handle hyphenation, particularly for "Quantenmechanik," ensuring everything is represented correctly. Time to finalize the HTML!
**Finalizing content lines**

I’m working on the final content lines for the transcription. The lines look like this: 

— dann besteht es "genau aus den Funktionen der Elemente von H*)"
Vor kurzem habe ich mir überlegt, wie der Ergodensatz in der Quanten- mechanik ohne "Einordnungsannahmen" benützen ist, "von welchen Annahmen". 

While I’m unsure if the final line is cut off, I’ll proceed as instructed. I need to include the MathJax script, even if it’s not strictly necessary. Ultimately, I’ll focus on delivering the HTML content only.
