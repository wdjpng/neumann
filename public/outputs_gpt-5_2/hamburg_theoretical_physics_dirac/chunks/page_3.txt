**Confirming image resolution**

I’m checking the alt text that says "resolution 1010 768," which suggests the dimensions are 1010 in height and 768 in width. Typically, the first number represents height, and the second represents width. The coordinate system starts at (0,0) in the top-left corner, so I’ll set the width as 768 and height as 1010. The instruction allows for chunks that span nearly the entire width of the page, possibly from x=30 to x=740, while ensuring to stay within the original image dimensions.
**Setting chunk parameters**

I’m thinking of setting x1=0 and x2=768 to cover the entire width for each chunk, which makes things simpler. I also have to be careful not to exceed the limits. Each chunk should contain complete lines without cutting across, and I won't exceed eight lines per chunk. It looks like the page has about 18-20 handwritten lines, so maybe I can split this into four chunks of 5-6 lines each. Also, the instructions suggest some overlap in cases of slanted lines. I'll need to plan those y ranges with a pixel overlap of 10-20 pixels.
**Determining pixel coordinates**

I need to pinpoint the exact pixel coordinates for this image with a height of 1010. There's a top and bottom margin to consider. For the chunks, I’m proposing these ranges: chunk 1 (0 to 240), chunk 2 (220 to 480), chunk 3 (460 to 720), chunk 4 (700 to 930), and chunk 5 (915 to 1009 for the footnote). I want to avoid cutting any lines, so I'll closely observe. I see the footnote text at the bottom and some small inline text too. I'll ensure bounding boxes cover the lines completely and include overlaps of 20-30 pixels, setting x1=0 and x2=767.
**Clarifying coordinate inclusivity**

I see that they didn’t specify whether to use inclusive coordinates. In a typical coordinate system, it feels safer to set the bottom-right corner as width-1, so I'll go with x2=767 and y2=1009 for a height of 1010. However, I’m pondering if x2=768 and y2=1010 might also be acceptable. The instructions mention integer pixel coordinates but don’t clarify inclusivity. To be cautious, I'll stick with x2=767 and y2=1009, ensuring I meet the requirements for outputting the resolution as (width, height).
**Setting and confirming chunk parameters**

I’m preparing to output the resolution as (768, 1010) and deciding on chunk heights based on the estimated y positions of the lines. I’m creating five chunks with specific boundaries to ensure no more than eight lines per chunk. Each chunk overlaps to include lines fully, with overlaps set at 60 pixels. I think these boundaries are appropriate, as each chunk contains about 5-6 lines. 

Here's the final output:

(0, 0, 767, 230)  
(0, 190, 767, 430)  
(0, 390, 767, 640)  
(0, 600, 767, 860)  
(0, 820, 767, 1009)  
(768, 1010)
