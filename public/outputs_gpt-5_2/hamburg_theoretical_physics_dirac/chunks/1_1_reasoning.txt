**Transcribing image text**

I need to transcribe the handwritten text in the image to HTML, keeping the formatting close and including line breaks, while ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The image features a cursive line that seems to be in German, starting with "-Theorie." After that, there's possibly a math segment that includes "jn = han ja" with some diacritics. I can see references to "g_11" and "g_44." I have to focus on these details as I transcribe carefully.
**Transcribing with accuracy**

I’m examining the text, noting it includes "(g11, g44 die Konst...)" and that "die konstan-" is underlined. It seems the full text reads something like "-Theorie Jn = lan ja (g11, g44 die konstant-". My goal is to produce HTML that's as accurate as possible, utilizing MathJax for the math elements and adding line breaks where needed. I'll style "konstan-" with an underline. It’s crucial that I only include visible text. This is a thin strip, and some parts might be cropped, but we’ll do our best!
**Crafting the transcription**

I'm trying to put together the transcription, starting with "-Theorie jn = han ja..." but something feels off. Maybe it should be "-Theorie: Jn = ..."? I need to follow the instruction to transcribe fully, while being careful since the handwriting is uncertain. 

I've decided to include a line that reads: "-Theorie Jn = han ja (g11, g44 die konstan-". Should I indicate any unclear characters with [illegible]? I think approximating it might work best for clarity, while also paying attention to the math elements as I write this out.
**Examining the text details**

I've noticed an overline above "ja" and also on "g," which might indicate that it reads as "jn = han ṡa." There's a chance it could be "In = ham ja," which hints at German. This is quite uncertain, though, so maybe I should use unicode shapes or placeholders for any unclear letters. 

To maintain the handwritten appearance, I’ll structure the HTML in a cursive-like font, perhaps "Georgia" or "Times New Roman." For the math, I can use MathJax: \( g_{11}, g_{44} \). I think I can present this neatly!
**Finalizing HTML with MathJax**

I need to create the HTML while including MathJax to render mathematical expressions. This involves placing the MathJax script in the HTML head section. Even if the application might load math automatically, I’ll include the script tag for good measure. 

The content should replicate the line as: "- Theorie jn = han ja ( \( \bar{g}_{11}, \bar{g}_{44} \) <u>die konstan-</u> )". I’ll use a cursive font in grey with italic formatting to mimic pencil writing. Finally, I’ll finalize the HTML with minimal structure, ensuring to follow all instructions carefully.
