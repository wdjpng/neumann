**Transcribing math text**

I need to transcribe the image text to HTML while keeping the formatting intact. I'm spotting what looks like "δσ + δν = 28 μ," although it might be more like "δσ + δ-θn." The curves in the cursive make it challenging. The right side is definitely "= 28 μv." I should also consider other variations like "δv + δv =" or even "ds + dv + dv = 28 μv." There are shapes that look like "g" in the handwriting, which might help clarify things.
**Transcribing cursive math**

The left side seems to read "∮ a f + ∮ f = 28 μν," but there are some small subscripts that I'm not completely certain about. It's crucial to transcribe accurately, even if I need to approximate. Since it's cursive math, it might actually be "δσ + δυ = 28 μv" or perhaps "δu + δu = 28 μv." I can use MathJax for Greek letters and ensure I reflect the drawn shapes. Another idea is to show ambiguous characters as they are, or even include an image instead of MathJax.
**Transcribing the math accurately**

I need to transcribe the text, and it appears as "δ φ v t + δ v φ n = 28 μν," but that's a bit tricky. I could mark unknowns with [?], but the instructions say to fully transcribe. Maybe it's actually "∫ v dt + v·dn = 28 μv," which sounds plausible. There’s a loop in the first integral, and "28 μv" definitely fits the known unit of microvolts. The right side looks like a capital V, confirming it's likely "∫ v dt + ∫ v·dn = 28 μv." But, wait, there are two integrals?
**Transcribing integral expressions**

The left side looks like "∮ vdt + v·dn = 28 μv," with some elongated, S-like integrals. There’s a J-shaped integral symbol at the left, followed by "vt." After a plus sign, there’s another integral followed by "v·dn." So, it might be "∫ v dt + ∫ v·dn = 28 μv," which fits. I’ll render this using MathJax and create HTML with a centered math expression that resembles handwriting, while keeping the formatting simple yet pretty. I'll ignore partially cut lines, focusing on clarity.
**Creating HTML for math**

I’m looking to produce a snippet that displays math in a pretty yet minimal style. I’ll create a `<div class="snippet">` that centers the math and mimics a handwritten font while keeping it simple. The font size will be about 1.6em, and I’ll ensure the text is centered with some margin for spacing. I also need to include the MathJax script from the CDN to render the equations, and I’ll add the standard MathJax v3 configuration. Let's get this output ready!
