**Transcribing image text**

I need to transcribe all visible text in the image to HTML, paying attention to line breaks and using MathJax for rendering math. The reviewer's instructions specify that the math letters are gamma, mu, v, and g, indicating Greek letters. I should ignore any partially cut-off lines, which might be at the top or bottom edges of the image. It seems I should focus on only the fully visible lines—so I'll examine the image content closely.
**Deciphering text snippets**

The text reads: "wo für die g μ die vel. [or vel.] gelten —". I'm attempting to decipher it left to right. The first visible line might be the lower half of a previous line, and there's a chance that it's partially cut at the top. Following the instruction to ignore partially cut lines, I think we should skip any top line if it's not complete. It seems I can see one central line fully and maybe part of another below it, so I’ll analyze carefully.
**Analyzing German text**

I notice another part that says: "so dass nur die Vertauschungsrelationen," which translates to "so that only the commutation relations." This likely appears in the second line. Then there's "der g μ und pν bekannt sind," probably meaning gamma (γ) and p (ν). The reviewer mentions that math letters include gamma, mu, v, and g. The text also includes "und die der xν, pμ nicht," or possibly "und die der xσ, pτ." I should carefully inspect the visible strings to clarify this text further.
**Deciphering further text**

I see the text "rel. gelten —," which means "relations hold." It could also be "ob. rel. gelten," possibly short for "oben relat." or "oblg." The word looks like it could be "Obgl.," but I can also see "ob." that might represent "oben." So is it "oblg. gelten—"? The first part might be "wo für die g μ die ob. rel. gelten —," making sense as "wo für die γμ die ob. Rel. gelten—." I need to faithfully transcribe whatever is legible, keeping clarity as a priority. The next line presents "so dass nur die Vertauschungsrelationen," which is quite clear.
**Preparing MathJax rendering**

I'm planning to include a MathJax script for rendering math in the HTML output. The user wants only HTML but using MathJax is necessary. I’ll add the typical script tag to load it and ensure we keep the structure minimal. First, I need to correctly transcribe the mathematical variables, like "g μ" as \( g_{\mu} \) and "pν" as \( p_{\nu} \). I’ll also maintain the long German word "Vertauschungsrelationen" in its entirety while including proper spacing. 

I want to ensure I accurately transcribe the visible lines and not include partially cut lines if applicable. The final output needs to look clean, with attention to handwritten styling, while presenting all variables and expressions appropriately. I'll take care to include strikethrough for marked terms and maintain clarity throughout the transcription.
**Finalizing the HTML output**

I need to carefully transcribe the line "und die der \( g_{\nu} \) \( p_{\mu} \) nicht," and I see I might have missed a comma. Since this is a transcription, I'll ensure to represent it accurately and respect the instruction to ignore partially cut lines. I’ll check for any faint partial lines, but I think I only see one entire line. 

Now, I'm going to code the HTML, using a container for proper formatting, and I plan to apply some stylish touches, like a Georgia font and a subtle background. I'll ensure to include the MathJax script as instructed.
