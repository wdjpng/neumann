**Calculating dimensions for chunking**

I need to get the correct width and height for my images from the dataset, which are 768 and 981 respectively. Since it's a typical letter page in portrait orientation, the aspect ratio confirms that these dimensions are right.

I should propose chunk boxes to capture lines, ensuring we use the full width. I’ll set x1=0 and x2=767 for the entire width, but I need to avoid adding too much blank space. For vertical y-coordinates, the top margin might be around 20 px, with lines ranging from y 90 to 430, and the signature around y 590 to 650.
**Examining crease and text positioning**

I see there's a fold line around y 470 and a horizontal crease near y 485. The text ends before the fold, just above the crease with the phrase that seems to start, "mein Handkuß zu übergeben." 

Interestingly, "Ihr sehr ergebener" appears just above the signature, which is below the crease at y 560. The crease is a bit above the signature at around y 460, which makes things a bit tricky. I need to ensure each line is fully included in one chunk, even if that means overlap.
**Defining text chunks**

I’m planning to define three chunks for the text based on coordinates. For chunk1, I’ll cover the top paragraph lines up to around y 365. Chunk2 will include the remainder of the paragraph down to y 500, and chunk3 will focus on the closing lines and signature, including "Ihr sehr ergebener," up to y 680.

Starting with the image height of 981, I estimate the top text starts at about y 75. I’ll set chunk1 from y=70 to y=260 for the first few lines. Chunk2 will be from y=240 to y=500, ensuring a 20 px overlap. For chunk3, I’ll aim for y=495 to y=700. I must remember to keep every line fully contained within those chunks!
**Refining text section chunks**

I’m focusing on defining text sections more accurately. Each line of handwriting is about 30-35 px in height, so I want to ensure there's a safe margin. For chunk1, I’ll set y1=60 and y2=260, which gives me coverage for about 5-6 lines. For chunk2, I’ll adjust it to y1=235 and y2=505. Chunk3 will range from y1=500 to y2=700.

I’ll use full width x1=0 and x2=767 to prevent cropping and ensure I capture everything. Now I'll output the rectangles in the format needed:

(0, 60, 767, 260)  
(0, 235, 767, 505)  
(0, 500, 767, 700)  
Finally, I need to verify if this captures all lines appropriately.
**Finalizing chunk dimensions**

I need to confirm if there are extra words lower in the text, but the bottom has some blank space except for an embossed stamp, which I can ignore. "Ihr sehr ergebener" is in the middle, and I’ll make sure it’s included. 

The instructions mention that no chunk should have more than eight lines of text and 2-4 lines of mathematical expressions. My plan is to set chunk1 to cover from y=40 to y=270, chunk2 from y=250 to y=520, and chunk3 from y=510 to y=720. 

This gives full coverage of the text while ensuring overlaps if needed, so I’ll finalize the coordinates as follows:

Chunk1: (0, 40, 767, 270)  
Chunk2: (0, 250, 767, 520)  
Chunk3: (0, 510, 767, 720)  

And finish with the final line coordinate of (768, 981).
