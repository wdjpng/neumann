**Formatting equations and styles**

I need to adjust the presentation of the three double integrals based on the reviewer's feedback. They asked for the third integral on a separate line, so I'll ensure there’s a line break before it and reduce spacing around the equations and text. I’ll also adjust the CSS to unify the style, using a consistent font like Georgia or Times. I’ll replicate the header styling while maintaining the overall typography for the body and math sections.
**Adjusting MathJax formatting**

I’m planning to use MathJax for LaTeX formatting and need to ensure that the content stays untouched while possibly improving line breaks for consistency. I should present all content logically and restructure where necessary to keep coherence. For spacing between equations and text, I’ll adjust the CSS to apply a margin of 0.5rem and maintain a consistent line-height. Also, I need to specifically format the three double integrals by placing the third on a separate line. Lastly, I’ll ensure consistency in margins and font size across paragraphs and equations.
**Unifying header and text styles**

I need to keep the header styled with "hand" italic as is while changing the earlier content's font choices. I'll unify everything to one consistent style instead of fancy fonts like "Comic Sans." The letter's content shouldn't be altered.

I must include the MathJax script for inline math and configure it with the standard settings. All equations will be formatted as block displays using $$...$$ for main equations and \( ... \) for inline. I'll also restructure the text into paragraphs with equations placed appropriately. I'll start by planning the content order, beginning with the header details.
**Organizing content**

I’m starting with a greeting and will reference unique solutions to commutation relations. I'll also mention the equation \( PQ - QP = \frac{h}{2\pi i} \). Then, I’ll bring in additional lines about the equations \( U(\alpha) V(\beta) = e^{i \alpha \beta} V(\beta) U(\alpha) \), along with discussions on their uniqueness. After that, I’ll introduce the unitary family with \( S(\alpha,\beta) \) and describe the integral equations related to operators. Finally, I’ll summarize the calculation rules, especially for the adjoint formula.
**Finalizing the document structure**

I’m organizing the document to ensure it meets all formatting requirements. I need to present three integrals with the third on a separate line and incorporate various equations related to \( S(u,v) \). I’ll maintain the original text fragments and keep them separate while ensuring the context is clear.

For CSS, I'll set margins to 0.25rem for equations and 0.6rem for paragraphs, while ensuring consistent line heights. I need to enable MathJax and unify fonts, while also keeping quotes as they are. Lastly, I'll format the HTML properly, using the specified DOCTYPE and sections.
**Structuring the content**

I’m planning the document layout using paragraphs while preserving all original variable names like "x, t" and "u, v." For various equations, I’ll ensure they’re included in block format while retaining their exact wording, including details like "S(-u,-v)\; \ldots\; S(u,v)=0." I need to be careful with spacing, using CSS for margins, and keeping the header primarily intact.

I’ll include everything from the greeting to complex integrals, ensuring that all required elements, including addresses and footnotes, are present, following a structured flow to maintain coherence and clarity.
**Creating the document structure**

I'm setting up the document body with a clear layout. Starting with the header, I'll include notes on the left and right. The greeting will follow, with the main content divided into paragraphs.

I'll keep all equations in designated blocks, ensuring clarity while maintaining their exact wording. Maintaining proper formatting is crucial, especially with footnotes and integral expressions. I’ll ensure spacing is minimal to keep everything neat and organized, and I’ll include the necessary MathJax configurations for any mathematical expressions. Finally, I plan to finalize the HTML code to ensure everything is well organized and visually appealing.
