**Rendering math expressions**

I’m looking at the fraction, which seems to show \( \frac{h}{2\pi i} \), potentially with something before the "i" in the numerator. The denominator is standard, so the expression comes out as \( \frac{h}{2\pi i} \times 1 \). I’ll create some HTML with MathJax inline for this. Since I want to keep it simple and pretty, I’ll center the equation and use an italic-style font, all while including the MathJax CDN script for rendering. It sounds fun to make it look artful!
**Creating HTML snippet**

I need to provide a minimal HTML snippet, including the MathJax script as instructed. They specifically mentioned to output only the HTML code without any additional formatting. I’ll set up a simple HTML document structure, including the head section. Since they want to follow the instruction closely, I'll make sure to include a span for any additional content they may need. It’s a straightforward task, but I want to make sure I'm following their directions exactly!
