**Formatting mathematical expressions**

I'm aiming to reproduce the content using LaTeX inside MathJax, which is a great way to render mathematical expressions. I should include a CDN script to load MathJax and provide the mathematical lines formatted with \( ... \) or $$ ... $$. 

I’ll ensure to write S(u, v) correctly instead of S(m, n) and be precise with the integrand, including terms like "a(α−u, β−v) S(α,β) dα dβ" and "e^{-½ i (uα − vβ)}." I want to be cautious not to include unknown letters.
**Finalizing mathematical expression**

I'm keeping the term as \( e^{- \tfrac{1}{2} i (u \alpha - v \beta)} \), but there are times it could be \( e^{-i/2 (u α + v β)} \). The image shows \( e^{- 1/2 i (u α - v β)} \), and I need to confirm the negative sign before \( v \)—it should be "−vβ." 

To maintain the double integral, I’ll use \( \iint \). The final line might look like: \( S(u,v) \iint ... = \iint e^{-1/2 i (u α − v β)} a(α−u, β−v) S(α,β) dα dβ \). I want to ensure I include all needed elements without losing meaning.
**Creating a styled math display**

I need to produce a single line of math, possibly within a centered block. The page has a letter format, but it’s just a strip, so I’ll focus on making it visually appealing. Centering the math and using a font that resembles a manuscript would help. A light beige background can mimic paper, though it may not be essential. Adding small caps for constants could enhance it, but I remember not to include any extra text. I'll keep the HTML minimal and ensure the MathJax script is loaded correctly.
**Crafting the math content**

I’m putting together the math expression: 

\[ S(u,v) \int\int \ldots = \int\int e^{- 1/2 i(u\alpha − v\beta)} a(\alpha−u, β−v) S(α, β) d\alpha dβ \]

In LaTeX, it looks like this: 

\[ S(u,v)\,\iint \ldots \;=\; \iint e^{-\tfrac{1}{2} i (u\alpha - v\beta)}\, a(\alpha - u, \beta - v)\, S(\alpha, \beta)\, d\alpha\, d\beta \]

I'll make sure to use parentheses and commas accurately and ensure spacing is good. Plus, I’ll center the math line while using "S(u,v)" without extra heavy formatting. I'm opting for "S" instead of a long form for clarity.
**Creating the HTML skeleton**

I'm setting up the HTML structure like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Transcription</title>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
<style> body {...}; .line{...}</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="line">
$$
S(u,v)\,\iint \ldots \;=\; \iint e^{-\tfrac{1}{2} i (u\alpha - v\beta)}\, a(\alpha - u, \beta - v)\, S(\alpha, \beta)\, d\alpha\, d\beta
$$
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

I need to ensure that there’s no additional text included, just the mathematical expression in the designated format. Once that’s complete, I’ll finalize everything!
