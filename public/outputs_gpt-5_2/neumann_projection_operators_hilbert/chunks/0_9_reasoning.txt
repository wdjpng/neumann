**Transcribing handwritten equations**

I need to transcribe the handwritten equation, but I’ll ignore any partially cut-off lines. The image seems to show an expression like " (∬ a(α,β) S*(α,β) dα dβ)* = ∬ \overline{a(−α,−β)} S*(α,β) dα dβ." I'm looking carefully at the left side, which appears to be "(∬ a(α,β) S*(α,β) dα dβ)*." The star placement and overline are interesting, but I need to clarify if "S(α,β)" refers to something specifically or "S*(α,β)." My focus remains on detailing this correctly.
**Analyzing integral notation**

It seems that the outer star represents the conjugate of the entire integral. So, I deduce that the inside should be S(α,β) without the star. The right side contains the overline a(-α,-β) multiplied by S*(α,β), confirming the conjugate property. However, I notice S' (α,β) might appear instead of S*. The notation shows a prime, not a star. I need to ensure that I accurately represent this in mathjax, recognizing that both sides use S'(α,β).
**Formatting the integral in HTML**

I'm set to adapt the equation: 

( ∬ a(α,β) S'(α,β) dα dβ )* = ∬ \overline{a(-α,-β)} S'(α,β) dα dβ.

This aligns with the visible overline I see. I need to create a minimal HTML document that includes the MathJax scripts to render these mathematical expressions properly. The prompt asks for this to be visually appealing, so I’ll center the equation on the page and ensure everything looks neat for the user. Time to put together a single HTML document!
