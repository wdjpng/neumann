**Transcribing mathematical text**

I need to transcribe some handwritten German text into HTML with MathJax for the equations. The text looks like: "(U(α) = e^{2πi/h??} a P, V(β) = e^{-i β Q} beschäftigt, und die Eindeutigkeit mit einer ziemlich einfachen Methode bewiesen*). Da dieselbe." 

Hmm, I should focus on the superscripts and positions. It seems "2πi" is meant to be over "h". The expression likely reads "e^{2π i / h} a P", but it could also be structured differently. I'll explore standard Weyl operators like U(α)=e^{iαP} and V(β)=e^{iβQ}.
**Interpreting Weyl operators**

In Weyl commutation, I know that U(a)=exp(i a P) and V(b)=exp(i b Q). The image shows U(α)=e^{2πi/h a P}. But wait, is that "h" with a bar? Maybe it's ħ instead? The "2πi" seems to be above 'h', suggesting it's a fraction. It might read as "e^{2π i / ħ a P}" or "e^{(2π i / h) a P}". For V(β)=e^{-i β Q}, the image shows "= e^{- i β Q}" with a minus before i, matching the German text about uniqueness proven with a simple method.
**Creating styled HTML with MathJax**

I need to ignore any partially cut-off lines while crafting the full HTML. For math, I’ll use inline \( \) and consider a nice cursive styling. The expression looks like: 

(U(α)= e^{(2\pi i/h) a P}, V(β)= e^{- i β Q}) beschäftigt, und die Eindeutigkeit mit einer ziemlich einfachen Methode bewiesen*). Da dieselbe.

I’ll ensure that Greek letters like α and β are styled correctly with MathJax. To keep it pretty, I’ll wrap everything in a container with a serif font like "Georgia." Plus, I'll include the MathJax CDN in the head for rendering the expressions. Finally, I’ll build a minimal HTML snippet that preserves necessary line breaks.
**Including a footnote marker**

I need to remember to add a small footnote marker "*)" as it’s indicated to be present. This will add clarity to the text and ensure proper referencing. It's a simple detail, but important to make sure the structure is complete and looks polished. So, I’ll integrate that seamlessly into the existing content when I produce the HTML snippet. Let’s get this finalized!
