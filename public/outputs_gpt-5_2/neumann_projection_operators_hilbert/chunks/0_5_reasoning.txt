**Transcribing math notation**

I need to transcribe the text from an image, which looks like a handwritten math equation. It seems to be S(α, β) = e^{-i/2 α β}. I'll zoom in on it mentally. The equation might involve typical Weyl commutation relations, and there are elements like U(α) and V(β). The user asks to ignore partially cut-off lines, and I see S(α, β) is visible. It looks like I need to focus on presenting this in HTML format only.
**Creating HTML with MathJax**

I need to provide some pretty formatting and ensure the MathJax script is included. The user wants only HTML code. I think it’s fine to include a script tag and present the equation in display math without overcomplicating it.

I’ll keep the styling simple—like using a serif font—but I won't go overboard with backgrounds. The equation I’ll format looks like:

$$S(\alpha,\beta)= e^{- \tfrac{i}{2}\alpha\beta}\, U(\alpha)V(\beta) = e^{\tfrac{i}{2}\alpha\beta}\, V(\beta)U(\alpha)$$

I’ll make sure to include MathJax and output the full HTML document.
