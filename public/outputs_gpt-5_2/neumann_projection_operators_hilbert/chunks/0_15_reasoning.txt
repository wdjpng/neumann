**Transcribing handwritten math**

I need to transcribe text from an image into HTML while preserving the formatting and use MathJax for the math parts. The image shows a handwritten snippet that could be interpreting as "S(-u, -v) S ... S(u, v) = 0." I think there might be a double less-than sign or something stylized in there. It looks like some elements are "≤" or just ellipses, possibly indicating relationship between the S terms. I'll clarify those symbols carefully!
**Transcribing and formatting math**

The script has a double ‘S’ as capital letters, not symbols, within the sequence: "S(-u, -v) S ... S(u, v) = 0." It's slightly ambiguous, but I’ll transcribe it as instructed, using MathJax for the math expressions. I’ll format the HTML to include a single line, centering the math inline. 

I'll make sure to include any necessary commas, particularly after "0." I’ll wrap it in a div, apply serif font, and increase the size while loading MathJax. Let's focus on the final HTML output!
