**Organizing content into chunks**

I'm considering breaking the content into chunks that are each about 120-150 pixels tall. It’s important to limit the equations to 3 or 4 lines per chunk to keep it manageable. I’m proposing 8 chunks for clarity, including a header, intro text, equations, methods, and footnotes. I’ll ensure that the end of each chunk overlaps slightly with the next one by about 20 pixels. I'll also pay attention to the coordinate width to make everything fit nicely.
**Setting coordinates for chunks**

I’m establishing the coordinates for the chunks using x1=0 and x2=767, as 768 seems to be the total width. The last pixel we'll use is x2=767 and y2=974. I’ve set the precise y-values for each chunk to ensure everything fits. Each chunk will be structured to keep the content easy to read and to avoid overwhelming with equations. I’ll just provide the coordinates for each chunk to finalize the layout.
