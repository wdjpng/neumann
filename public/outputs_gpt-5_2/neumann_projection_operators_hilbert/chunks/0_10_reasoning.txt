**Transcribing a letter**

I need to transcribe text from the image of a letter into HTML, maintaining the original formatting and math with MathJax. I should keep line breaks and ignore cut-off lines. The reviewer has instructed that the first letters in function S are u and v, not m and n, so it should be S(u,v) instead of S(m,n). The formula excerpt mentions "S(m,n) = ∬ e^{i(...?)} a(α - m, β - n) S(α,β) dα dβ," but I must ensure I use u and v accurately. I’ll double-check the image for clarity.
**Analyzing the integral**

I need to examine the text around "S(m,n)" more carefully. It seems like it might start with "S ....", but I'm not sure what exactly it is. The exponent should be something like e^{iζ (uα - vβ)} or maybe e^{i2π (uα - vβ)}, which is typical in Fourier transforms. I see the scribble has "e^{i 2π (uα - vβ)}" but there's a 'ζ' or perhaps '2π i' too. I should confirm that the function is actually S(u,v), as the reviewer insisted. So we’ll have S(u,v) = ∬ e^{i2π(vα - uβ)} a(α-u, β-v) S(α,β) dα dβ. I need to be very careful with the transcription to avoid mistakes!
**Transcribing formatting details**

The instructions say to keep the formatting as close as possible and to ignore partially cut-off lines while ensuring we fully transcribe all the text from the image. If I'm unsure about some exponent characters, I can use unclear placeholders, but I definitely shouldn't make things up. The user wants an accurate transcription. 

I see the exponent might be written as "e^{i( vα - uβ)}," which simplifies things. I'm noticing that after "e^," there could be "i ζ i," and that might be the Greek letter "ζ," also known as zeta. I'll go with e^{i ζ (vα - uβ)} for clarity.
**Deciphering the formula**

I’m trying to interpret the scribbles, which look like a curly z with maybe two dots. It might be "i 2π," which is common. The equation seems to show e^{?i? (vα - uβ)}, and the parentheses clearly indicate "vα - uβ". So far, that seems correct. The formula includes "a(α-u, β-v) S(α,β) dα dβ," which looks plausible.

Now, for the starting part, it seems to show "S^{?}(u,v)". I’m noticing a superscript is likely present, but it’s not clear if it’s "S^{" or possibly "S'(u,v)" with a prime. I'll need to confirm what the scribble indicates.
**Transcribing the equation**

I see there's a superscript after S that might be "t," but the reviewer only mentioned using u and v. So, I think S'(u,v) could be correct. The equation shows “S'(u,v) = ∬ e^{i ζ (vα - uβ)} a(α-u, β-v) S(α,β) dα dβ,” and I need to ensure I include the double integrals. 

The earlier text appears to be "S....", but considering the instructions, it might be safer to omit it. I want to present the formula cleanly, using MathJax. The choice of the variable for the exponential is tricky; I'll go with e^{iζ (vα - uβ)}. 

In HTML, I’ll format it like this:

<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<style> body { font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; } .line { margin: 1em 0; font-size: 1.5rem; }</style>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<div class="line">
$$ S'(u,v) = \iint e^{i\zeta (v\alpha - u\beta)} a(\alpha - u, \beta - v) S(\alpha,\beta) d\alpha d\beta, $$
</div>
</body>
</html>
**Finalizing the transcription**

The instruction is to fully transcribe all text from the image, so I shouldn't omit any legible parts. I want to include the ellipsis and the preceding “S,” but it seems the image only shows "S...". To avoid mistakes, I think I should drop any stray text.

I’ll display the equation like this:

<div class="line">
<span class="lead">S ...</span>
<span class="eq">\( S'(u,v) = \iint e^{i\zeta (v\alpha - u\beta)} a(\alpha - u, \beta - v) S(\alpha,\beta) d\alpha d\beta, \)</span>
</div>

I’ll ensure I use the correct Greek letters and spacing in the final HTML. Let’s wrap everything up!
