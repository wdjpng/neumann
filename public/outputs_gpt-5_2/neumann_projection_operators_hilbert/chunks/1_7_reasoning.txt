**Transcribing math content**

I need to transcribe text from an image of a handwritten math line, while ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The left side seems like it says "S(m, v)", but it should likely be "S(u, v)" based on the letters. The formula looks like "S(u,v) f_{αβ} = e^{(i/2)(u β - v α)} f_{α+u, β+v}". It resembles a common formula in physics. I'll transcribe it accordingly, making sure to include MathJax for proper formatting.
**Creating HTML for MathJax**

I need to create HTML to load MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions. It’s suggested to wrap the math in \( ... \), and I'm thinking a simple, pretty header style is nice, even if handwritten isn't necessary. I want to center the line and present the math in display style. 

The formula I’ll use is:

S(u,v) f_{αβ} = e^{\frac{i}{2}(u β - v α)} f_{α+u, β+v}

I’ll convert Greek letters to proper HTML entities like \alpha and \beta. The final output will properly include the MathJax script. Let's make sure the line looks complete!
