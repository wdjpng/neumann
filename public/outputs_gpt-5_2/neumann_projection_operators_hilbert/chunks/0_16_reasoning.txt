**Creating HTML with MathJax**

The user wants to include MathJax to render equations, so I'll add the standard MathJax configuration script in the HTML head. They specifically requested a full HTML page with this included. I'll style it to have a handwritten appearance, perhaps using a cursive font and managing spacing while keeping the original line breaks intact. Even though it’s a long line, I’ll ensure it breaks appropriately without cutting off any lines. Let's get to crafting this properly!
