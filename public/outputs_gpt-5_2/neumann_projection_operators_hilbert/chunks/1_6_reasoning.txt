**Transcribing mathematical expression**

I need to transcribe a mathematical expression carefully: e^{-1/4((α - γ)²) - 1/7(β - δ)² + 2i(αδ - βγ). Let’s take a closer look. It seems like I might be missing closing parentheses based on what I see. The expression starts with "e - 1/4(α - γ)²" and also includes "− 1/7(β - δ)²" plus "2i(αδ - βγ." I need to confirm all parts are included correctly before finalizing it.
**Formatting mathematical expression in HTML**

The image shows the expression possibly ending after "-βγ," which might suggest a trailing part. I shouldn’t worry too much since it’s fully visible. I need to use MathJax for rendering this in HTML, while keeping the formula centered. I should include the MathJax script and format the expression properly with delimiters. I'll craft a minimal HTML document, ensuring I transcribe the expression accurately with all necessary components, including the closing parenthesis. Here’s how I’ll write it: e^{-\tfrac14(\alpha-\gamma)^2 - \tfrac17(\beta-\delta)^2 + 2 i (\alpha\delta - \beta\gamma)}.
**Creating centered HTML with MathJax**

I need to ensure the mathematical expression is centered and displayed with a larger font. I’ll set this up in HTML by including the MathJax v3 script for rendering. The focus will be on formatting so that the expression stands out clearly in a visually appealing way. I want to make sure that everything blends well together, presenting a nice, clean look for optimal readability!
