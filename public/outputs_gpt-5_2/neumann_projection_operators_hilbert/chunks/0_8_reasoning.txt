**Transcribing German handwriting**

I need to transcribe text from an image with German cursive handwriting, carefully replicating the formatting. The snippet includes a mid-line that’s partially cut off on both edges, but it instructs me to ignore those parts. The visible text reads: "mit also (über die ganze α, β-Ebene) absolut integrierbaren 'Kern' a (x,y?)." I’m deciding whether the ending is "m" or "n," but it looks like "integrierbaren." It seems there's a part that says "a (α, β)" too.
**Crafting HTML for transcription**

I’m working on the next part of the transcription, which reads: "Es ist leicht, die Rechenregeln für diese Kerne anzugeben, insbesondere ist." That seems to fit well with what I've deciphered so far—starting with "mit also (über die ganze α, β-Ebene) absolut integrierbaren 'Kern' a (α,β)." 

To present this in HTML, I need to create line breaks and ensure the Greek letters \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are wrapped correctly. For a handwritten look, I’ll use a cursive-like font such as "Georgia" or "Times New Roman" within a centered container.
**Creating minimal HTML structure**

I’m focusing on presenting the text as a single line: 

"… mit also (über die ganze α, β-Ebene) absolut integrierbaren 'Kern' a (α,β). Es ist leicht, die Rechenregeln für diese Kerne anzugeben, insbesondere ist."

I need to be careful with quotes around "Kern"—the image shows it in quotes, but I’ll keep standard quotes. I'll include the MathJax script since it’s needed for math rendering, specifically using inline formatting \( \). Now, I’ll create a minimal HTML structure with the DOCTYPE, head, style, and body to fit the requirements.
