**Transcribing text from an image**

I need to transcribe text from an image into HTML while keeping the formatting intact and ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The text is in German cursive and seems to start with "bestimmen einen Raum ω." I'll treat the Greek omega as ω. There are references to invariant space involving V’(g) and S’(g,d). I need to double-check the spelling and formatting to ensure accuracy, especially with words like "Unschädlichkeit" and "Invariabilität." Let's proceed carefully!
**Transcribing text accurately**

I see the text includes "Irreduzibilität!" with an exclamation and parentheses. I want to make sure it fits with "also Irreduzibilität!" The next phrase confirms it's "der volle Hilbertsche Raum" so I’ll keep on track. There's mention of U’(j) that looks plausible as well. To ensure clarity, I’m considering placeholders for any unclear bits, like using [%]. My goal is to create minimal HTML with a handwriting-like font to make it visually pleasing, even if it’s not strictly necessary. Let's keep it neat!
**Implementing HTML with MathJax**

I’ll use a centered styled container with a `<pre>` element to preserve line breaks, even though there's only one line. Per instructions, I’ll include the MathJax script for displaying math expressions like omega and primes correctly. Since the line appears intact, I’ll focus on formatting it properly. I’ll implement the HTML with the styled container and include MathJax inline, such as \( \omega \) for proper formatting of expressions like S'(g,d) within math symbols. Let’s get this done!
