**Transcribing handwritten math**

I need to transcribe this handwritten equation clearly. It appears to show an equation starting with "= 1/(4π^2)(S(α,β)Af, S(γ,δ)Af) = 1/(4π^2)(AS(-γ,-δ)S(α,β)Af, f) = ? I'm not sure if I've got it right. It looks like I need to confirm the parts, especially the denominator and any missing fraction bars. I definitely want to ensure the transcription is faithful to what I’m seeing!
**Transcribing mathematical expression**

The handwriting shows an equation: "= 1 over 4π^2 (S(α,β)Af, S(γ,δ)Af) = 4π^2 (AS(-γ,-δ)S(α,β)Af, f) =". I think I can see a "1" before the 4π^2 in the second part, but I need to be careful not to guess too much. Since the line isn't cut off, I'll use MathJax to format this correctly. I'll put this all in a centered div with the appropriate HTML formatting. Let's write that out!
**Considering formatting details**

I’m wondering if I should keep the leading equal sign in my display math. Since it’s part of the equation, it makes sense to include it. Including it helps maintain the integrity of the expression. If I'm formatting this properly in MathJax, I’ll want to ensure that all elements, including the leading equal sign, are properly represented. Let's go ahead and make sure it’s all there!
