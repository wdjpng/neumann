**Transcribing mathematical equations**

I need to transcribe the handwritten integral equation into HTML with MathJax, ensuring accuracy. I see the integral expressions: "∬ a(α,β) S'(α,β) dα dβ" and possibly "∬ b- a(β) S'(α,β) dα dβ". It's tricky to interpret, especially regarding the second integral. It might follow a symmetrical pattern. After the equal sign, it appears to transition to "∬ c(α,β) S(α,β) dα dβ," which has no prime on S. I’ll need to clarify details further.
**Formatting mathematical equations**

I'm working on the output for a mathematical equation involving integrals in HTML with MathJax. The equation I need is "∬ a(α,β) S'(α,β) dα dβ · ∬ b(α,β) S'(α,β) dα dβ = ∬ c(α,β) S(α,β) dα dβ". I’ll keep everything readable and ensure the presentation includes a clean and stylish format. I want to make it visually appealing with a cursive-like style, centered, while including the necessary MathJax script. Let’s finalize this nicely!
