**Transcribing handwriting**

I need to transcribe some handwriting. It shows "bzw. ihrer Gleichungen," which I double-check and confirm. The formula appears to be "V(α) V(β) = e^{i α β} V(β) V(α)," but I wonder if that should be "e^{i α β}" since it probably refers to a phase. It looks like it might connect to the Weyl relations, which I recognize. I'm rethinking the first letters; they could be "U(α) V(β)," and the second part could indeed be "V(β) U(α)." This is intricate!
**Transcribing equations**

I have to transcribe some physics text, and I’m deciding to use "U" instead of "V" for the first part of the pair. However, the right side of the image shows an overline over "U," which is tricky. The text "bzw. ihrer Gleichungen" translates to "respectively their equations." I'll format it in a neat way, using MathJax for the equations. Since we want it to look nice, I think a simple serif font will work well, although we can’t replicate handwriting perfectly. I'll present it in two lines for clarity and elegance.
**Creating formatted equations**

I’m planning to set up a letter using a `<div class="letter">` and style it with CSS to use "Georgia" or "Times New Roman," plus cursive. I want to avoid using external resources where possible. They’ve requested incorporating MathJax to render mathematical expressions. I'll make sure to include the MathJax CDN as part of this setup. I can format the inline TeX like this: \( U(\alpha) V(\beta) = e^{i\alpha\beta}\, V(\beta)\, U(\alpha) \). Let's get this all produced!
