**Transcribing German cursive**

I need to transcribe some German cursive text. The line I see seems to read "Dann erkennt man durch die leichte Rechnungen," but I'm not sure about that "durs." After zooming in mentally, it looks like it should be "durch die leichten Rechnungen" instead of "durch die leichte Rechnungen." I think "Rechnung" is singular and should just end with “ung.” Also, I need to note that “Dann” should have a capital “D,” but it actually looks like the text has a lowercase “d.” This is tricky!
**Decoding a mathematical expression**

I'm looking at the mathematical expression, which includes "A ≠ 0, A = A*, A S(m,v) = 2π e^{-1/4 u^2 - 1/4 v^2}". I'm unsure about the part that seems to follow after the equals sign, as I think it reads "2π e^{-1/4 u^2 - 1/4 v^2}" and ends with "/ A." It looks like "A*" has a star superscript as well, indicating there's a bit of complexity here! I might need to simplify it to "A ≠ 0, A = A*, A S(u,v) = 2π e^{-1/4 u^2 - 1/4 v^2} / A." I’ll need to clarify that slash and ‘A’ at the end.
**Analyzing mathematical expressions**

I'm considering an alternative reading of the expression: "A ≠ 0, A = A*, A S(u,v) A^{-1} = 2π e^{-1/4 u^2 - 1/4 v^2}." I think the "A^{-1}" makes sense and could represent "/ A" since it feels consistent with division. However, this might lead to discrepancies because multiplying by "A" on the left and dividing on the right doesn’t quite align. I see there's a trailing "A" after a slash, possibly suggesting "÷ A." It's also possible that this sequence is a list of statements with commas, making it a bit tricky to decode!
**Transcribing the expression**

I'm trying to untangle the pattern I see, which might be "A S (u,v)" with "S" possibly being some script like "ϕ." It looks like there could be a superscript "^{(m,v)}" involved too. My best interpretation so far is "A ≠ 0, A = A*, A S(u,v) A^{-1} = 2π e^{-1/4 u^2 - 1/4 v^2}." This feels tidy, but I also see a suggestion of "A^5(m,v)" or maybe "A^s(m,v)". 

But hold on, "S" could still fit with the idea of a Fourier transform kernel, which makes me think of the Gaussian transform. The task is to transcribe accurately, so to replicate this, I think I'll craft some HTML using MathJax. I’ll start with the cursive sentence "Dann erkennt man durch die leichte Rechnungen" for good measure.
**Rendering mathematical expressions**

I'm working with some MathJax lines that say: "A ≠ 0, A = A^{*}, A S(u,v) A^{-1} = 2\pi e^{- \tfrac14 u^{2} - \tfrac14 v^{2}}." However, I noticed there's an alternate version: "A ≠ 0, A = A*, A S(u,v) A = 2π e^{-1/4 u^2 - 1/4 v^2} / A." I think I'll settle on the more balanced version: "A ≠ 0, A = A*, A S(u,v) = 2π e^{-1/4 u^2 - 1/4 v^2} A." 

I'm also considering that there's a possibility for a slash before the last 'A' just being a line break artifact. I need to be cautious about how I might transcribe it, so I should embrace a more literal approach, including slashes and parentheses. I’ll craft the HTML to give it a nice, handwriting-like font for aesthetics!
