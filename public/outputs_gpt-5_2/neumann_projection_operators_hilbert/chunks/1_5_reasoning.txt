**Transcribing math to HTML**

I need to transcribe some handwritten math into HTML, specifically using MathJax for expressions. There's a strip with visible equations, but I have to ignore any partially cut-off lines. The first part shows "1 over 2π*" with a star subscript. I need to read carefully, as it gets complex. After analyzing further, it seems like I have a combination of terms—maybe (αδ - βγ), which makes sense in this context. I'll keep it straightforward!
**Clarifying terms and HTML setup**

I’m dealing with some math terms: -1/4(α-γ)² - 1/4(β-δ)² + 2/3 i (αδ - βγ). I think "d" might refer to δ, while "γ" looks like gamma. The exponent terms are typical for Gaussian functions. On the right side, it seems like I see something like "(Af, f) = e^{.....} (f, f) =", but the image might have cut-off parts. Anyway, I need to only include decipherable content in HTML with MathJax to render these expressions properly. I'll make sure to include the script tag for MathJax!
**Creating a centered equation**

I'm working on writing a centered line equation: \( = \frac{1}{2\pi} e^{-\frac{1}{4} (\alpha - \gamma)^2 - \frac{1}{4} (\beta - \delta)^2 + \frac{2}{3} i (\alpha \delta - \beta \gamma)} \quad (Af,f) = e^{\cdots} (f,f) = \). I’m considering whether to use \( 2\pi \) or \( 2\pi_* \), but I'll just go with \( 2\pi \) since that seems clearer. I plan to present this as a single display math block with line breaks. Let's be neat and craft the HTML body!
