**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe text to HTML while keeping the formatting intact, including line breaks. There’s an image of handwritten text that requires careful reading. I see some blurred scribble with what looks like "Nun erst" on the left, and maybe "Nun oft." The top part seems partially cut off, making it tricky. The middle is clearer, but there's also weird math notation that seems nonsensical. Despite these challenges, I’ll do my best to transcribe it accurately while following the instructions about partially cut-off lines.
**Transcribing math and text**

The mathematics on the bottom line presents challenges for clarity. I see something like "(f α, A r, d) = (S(a|B|f, E S(σ d)) f)." I need to be cautious since the instructions ask to use MathJax for formulas. Should I represent unclear characters as "?" or blanks, or stick with direct reproduction? It’s difficult! There's also the possibility of focusing only on clear text, which seems to say "Nun ist." This translates to "Now is" in German. I need to ensure accuracy while transcribing these details.
**Analyzing scribbled text**

On the second line, there’s a scribble that's crossed out, followed by something like "(f α,β, A r, d) =". It could be "(fα,β,A r,d) =," but I'm unsure. It’s essential to only include parts I’m confident about, like "Nun ist" and possibly a formula with parentheses and equals signs. The key is transcribing all text without guessing the unknown parts. Since there's no indication to exclude unreadable sections, I could represent unclear text as "illegible" or leave it blank. Additionally, I will ignore any faint text from bleed-through.
**Transcribing with MathJax**

I can create a simple HTML format with line breaks and include the MathJax script since they asked for it to render mathematical expressions. We can use inline TeX inside \( \). However, they probably just want the transcribed text with proper formatting. The basic structure could be:

Nun ist  
[scribbled out]  
\( (f \alpha,\beta, A r, d) = (S(a|B|f, E S(\sigma d)) f) = \)

I must avoid too many assumptions, so using placeholders like "..." for unclear parts might help. Yet the requirement is to fully transcribe everything, so I’ll attempt to include all text without omitting the formula if it’s visible. I'll double-check the details to ensure accuracy.
**Creating HTML transcription**

I think I need to create a straightforward HTML with proper formatting and include MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions as requested. The first line should read "Nun ist" followed by a line for scribbled text represented as "[scribble]." The formula part could be:

\( (f \alpha, \beta, A r, d) = (S(a, B, f, E S(\sigma d)) f) = \)

I should avoid making guesses about unclear parts, so using a placeholder for scribbles is sensible. I’ll aim to present a tidy HTML structure, making sure to keep the formatting close to the original while incorporating the necessary MathJax scripts. Finally, I’ll finalize everything to deliver a clear and accurate output!
