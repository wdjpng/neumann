**Crafting HTML layout**

I think the document might be slightly trimmed on the left and right edges, with the start of the word “versprochen” visible. The next line seems out of frame, so I’ll ignore that. The header needs to be clear with nice typography. I’m planning to create an HTML layout with a centered header styled in uppercase and serif font. I’ll add a small left margin for “3./” at the top left and include cursive text for “versprochen, die in 1-2 Wochen.” While thinking about mathjax for "1-2," I realize it’s just normal text, so it's not required. Let’s move forward!
