**Transcribing German cursive text**

Alright, I’m tasked with transcribing text from an image snippet in German cursive. The lines are pretty clear: 

"ein Manuskript abgeschlossen 
hatte, das ich mit dem Titel 
'The unity of Haar's Measure' 
in den 'Annals of Mathematics' 
publizieren wollte. Seine Länge ist 
das von Ihnen angegebene 
Maximum: ca. 15 normale 
Druckseiten. Ich möchte daher Ihnen"

I need to keep the line breaks and handle any umlauts. It looks like these lines are complete and fully visible. I'll craft the HTML with preformatted text, but I won't include MathJax since there are no mathematical expressions to render. Let’s focus on producing the HTML output.
**Styling the transcription**

I’m thinking about how to style the transcription. I want to keep it simple while using the `<pre>` tag to maintain line breaks and give it a handwritten feel. A cursive font through CSS would add some charm. 

I’m crafting the HTML, ensuring that everything is correct with the content being displayed, especially quotes in their original form. I'll produce a piece of HTML that features the characters precisely as they appeared, including the straight quotes for "The unity of Haar's Measure" and "Annals of Mathematics." Time to finalize this!
