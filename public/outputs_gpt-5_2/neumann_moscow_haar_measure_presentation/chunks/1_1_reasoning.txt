**Creating Minimal HTML**

I'm considering how to present the content, especially since the last line might be partially visible from the screenshot. I want to include line breaks for clarity. Although there's no stylized header, I can still make it visually appealing using a cursive font. I should include MathJax script tags even if there's no math content. My plan is to craft minimal HTML with a centered narrow column and a handwritten-style font using CSS, with paragraphs for presentation. Let's get to it!
