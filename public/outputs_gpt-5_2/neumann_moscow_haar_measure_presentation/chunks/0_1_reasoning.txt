**Transcribing German letter**

I need to transcribe a handwritten German letter segment while maintaining the formatting in HTML. Ignoring any partially cut-off lines, I can read the content. It starts with "Lieber Herr Alexandroff," which appears to be spelled with a double "f." The following lines include thanks for a kind request regarding the sender's Moscow lectures and a mention of a manuscript written for a congress talk in May 1935. I need to ensure accuracy with the handwriting, especially with the titles and any unique spellings.
**Deciphering German text**

I’m examining the text closely, specifically the third line, which says "meine Moskauer Vorträge Ihnen in." The fourth line appears to have "excerp to," but since German typically uses "Exzerpt," it might actually be "excerpto," which could derive from Latin. The handwriting shows "excerpto," so perhaps it refers to “in excerpt.” I need to transcribe accurately, ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The next section reads "Es trifft," confirming the spelling. I need to verify if "ein Manuskript aufgeschrieben" is fully visible before stopping at cut lines. It seems promising!
