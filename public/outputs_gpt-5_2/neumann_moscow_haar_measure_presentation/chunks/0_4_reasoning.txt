**Transcribing text from image**

I need to transcribe visible text from the image, preserving formatting and line breaks while ignoring cut-off lines. The image shows German cursive handwriting, and I see that the top line might be partially cut off with "... fertig sein wird." It looks like the first visible line starts with "fertig." The instructions say to ignore partially cut-off lines, but it doesn't seem to be incomplete. Since it seems like a continuation, I'll include it.
**Transcribing subsequent text**

Let's read the subsequent text carefully. The first line is likely the end of a paragraph, as it reads, "fertig sein wird." Then, I see "Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich," where I suspect there's an old German orthography with "ß." Moving to "von den Mühen des Kongresses," that looks correct. 

Then it says "— er war ja für Sie gewiss." I notice "gewiß" might be written with ß. The next part includes quotes around "mühevoll," and I'll make sure to include those. Finally, “genussreich” looks fine, but I wonder if it might be "genusreich."
**Finalizing transcription and formatting**

I believe "genussreich" is correct as it includes 'ss' rather than 'ß'; that's standard. The text "gut erholt haben. Wir alle" looks fine. I also see "denken mit dem größten," which uses 'ß' correctly. The line "Vergnügen an die entrückenden" is visible, but the bottom might be cut. I'll only include what I can see clearly. 

Then, I want to create a nice HTML layout that mimics a handwritten letter. I’ll use a centered container with a cursive font and a subtle paper texture in the background. MathJax isn't necessary here since there are no formulas.
**Creating HTML output**

I need to ensure that I use line breaks with `<br>`, and I definitely want to include the long dash "—" as well. I’ll make sure that any quotes are kept intact as " ". My focus here is solely on producing the HTML code, so I'll get that structured correctly. Let's keep it clean and simple, focusing on the necessary elements for the transcription while following the styling we've discussed.
