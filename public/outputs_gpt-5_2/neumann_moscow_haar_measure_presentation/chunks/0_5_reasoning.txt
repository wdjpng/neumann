**Transcribing text from image**

I need to transcribe text from an image to HTML while keeping the formatting intact and ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The image shows the handwritten German text ending with "Mit den besten Grüssen, bin ich Ihr ergebener J. v. Neumann," along with some marginal notes like "Hs 160: 164." I’ll only include fully visible lines, such as the greeting, signature, and those right-side notes, while confirming if there's a period after the signature.
**Crafting HTML for a letter closing**

I’m thinking about how to format the HTML for the letter closing. I’ll center the closing lines, maybe right-align them while keeping the typical closing "Mit den besten Grüssen" on the left. I want to use a cursive-like font styled with CSS, incorporating italics and a script font fallback. I'll create a simple main container with padding, a blockquote-like element for the cursive text, and include a signature styled larger with spacing. Oh, and I might add a small vertical right margin note for "Hs 160:" and "164." Now I’ll just output the HTML code!
