**Finalizing the styled container**

I’m thinking about creating a styled container that mimics handwriting with a max-width of 720px and centered margin. I need to incorporate MathJax to render any mathematical expressions, but it seems like there’s none included right now. I should ensure that all lines are fully visible, including the first line starting with "längere," which might not be partial. Finally, I’m preparing to output it with a `<div class="letter">` to maintain the design simplicity.
