**Considering letter formatting**

I'm thinking the best way to handle this is to create a unified letter that combines the content into paragraphs while removing hyphenations caused by line breaks. The instruction says not to alter the content, but I believe removal of line-break hyphens could improve readability. I want to synthesize a consistent format while still being mindful of preserving accuracy in hyphenated words. It's a bit tricky, but readability is key, so finding a balance is important!
**Exploring text formatting options**

I'm considering another approach to enhance readability while not altering the content. I think we can keep the lines as they are but join them into paragraphs with manual line breaks, ensuring we preserve necessary hyphenations. The idea is to maintain hyphenations unless they're awkwardly split across different fragments. Also, we could unify the text into continuous paragraphs instead of using unnecessary newlines. I’ll go with using `<p>` tags for structuring the text effectively!
**Transcribing letter content**

I plan to transcribe the content into paragraphs, combining full sentences while reconstructing any words broken by hyphens. However, I'm wondering if this is allowed since the letter uses hyphenation typical for typescripts. Modern transcription usually removes hyphenation at line breaks, but the instruction to "not alter content" might complicate things. The user asked to preserve the exact wording, so I’ll keep fragments intact and only remove duplicate lines. I'll also keep the header from the first file almost as is.
**Structuring the letter content**

I'm thinking about how to set up this letter. I plan to embed the content inside a container called "page" and start with the greeting, "Lieber Herr Professor Bernays!" After that, I'll include the text lines as described. Then comes the explanation from 'I.-XI.'—which unfortunately is truncated mid-sentence in the current file. I need to mention that there's another file where the continuation is provided, discussing the induction of formulas and basic variables. It's a bit complex, but I think I can handle it!
