**Transcribing German text**

I've got to transcribe some handwritten German text, and I need to be careful to only include fully visible lines while ignoring any that are partially cut off. The image shows the bottom part of a page, and some lines are cut at the top. One visible line ends with "vermieden werden könnten," and it seems the previous line might begin earlier. I notice that the first visible line starts mid-sentence and is fully visible, so I’ll include it. The second line is also complete and visible; it contains umlauts.
**Formatting HTML text**

I need to format the text, specifically the line "(Es wäre hier möglich, das Definierte stets durch das Definierende zu ersetzen.)" in HTML while preserving line breaks. The request is for a simple yet pretty format that resembles a handwritten letter, but without a header. I’ll avoid using MathJax since it’s not necessary. I see that the original text uses German-style quotes, so I’ll ensure those are included correctly around "möglich." Finally, I’ll add an em dash at the end and use `<br>` for line breaks.
**Creating HTML structure**

I’m planning to output minimal HTML, using a styled container that mimics a paper background without any images. I want to use a cursive font from CSS, possibly something generic like "cursive." It’s important to ensure that all characters are displayed properly. For the structure, I’ll create a `<div class="letter">` and use `<br>` for the text lines. I think this will give it a nice, handwritten feel!
