**Transcribing image details**

I need to perform OCR on an image that shows a signature, "J. v. Neumann," which looks correct. Underneath, there’s an address line, "Budapest, V., Arany Janos ucca 16," where "utca" translates to "street" in Hungarian. The handwriting appears to have an old spelling. I want to ignore faint text and focus on the main lines. I’ll craft an HTML layout, ensuring the signature is prominent and aesthetically pleasing with some CSS styling. Let's keep it straightforward and visually appealing!
**Creating HTML structure**

I want to create a stylish container with appropriate margin and padding, using a serif font. The signature should be in a script font like 'Brush Script MT' or 'Lucida Handwriting', giving it a handwritten feel. For the "Adresse:" label, I’ll underline it, creating a visual separation. The address will follow on the same line but slightly lower, with an italic cursive style. I think using flexbox will help position these elements nicely. Let’s keep the HTML clean and minimal for a polished look!
