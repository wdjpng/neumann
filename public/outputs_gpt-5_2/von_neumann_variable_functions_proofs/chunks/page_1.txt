**Planning chunking for letter**

I need to split the handwritten letter into rectangular chunks, ensuring each line is fully contained within the page width. Given the page size of 768x985 pixels, I'll aim for about 10 chunks that span the width. The lines are slightly slanted, so incorporating small overlaps will help keep things tidy. I plan to use around 6 chunks with overlaps of 10-20 pixels, and I'll also make sure to limit math expressions to a few lines per chunk, keeping everything clear.
**Defining chunks for the letter**

I'm planning to create distinct chunks for the handwritten letter. Chunk 1 will cover the header and date from y=0 to y=210 across the full width of the page. Chunk 2 will include the greeting and the first math line, spanning y=190 to y=360, with some overlap. I'll continue this pattern for the following chunks, adjusting their positions accordingly, ensuring no chunk contains more than 8 lines of text and limiting math lines to 1-2 per chunk for clarity.
**Adjusting chunk boundaries**

I'm adjusting the chunk boundaries to ensure all math content is fully captured without splitting any single expression across chunks. To do this, I'll increase the overlap to around 60-80 pixels for safety, given that the lines are slightly slanted. The revised boundaries will be as follows: 

Chunk 1: y 0-240, Chunk 2: y 200-380, Chunk 3: y 360-540, Chunk 4: y 520-700, Chunk 5: y 680-860, and Chunk 6: y 840-985. This setup gives sufficient overlap, ensuring every line is included in at least one chunk. Everything looks good!
**Finalizing coordinates**

I’m returning the coordinates as integers for each chunk. They are:

(0, 0, 768, 240)  
(0, 200, 768, 380)  
(0, 360, 768, 540)  
(0, 520, 768, 700)  
(0, 680, 768, 860)  
(0, 840, 768, 985)  

The final image resolution will be (768, 985). Everything is set to go, and I’m ready to deliver this information!
