**Transcribing image text to HTML**

I need to transcribe the text from an image to HTML while keeping the formatting intact, especially line breaks. The image has cursive German handwriting, and it starts with a request for understanding about missed communication on Saturday due to other visits. The sender is asking to return their notes since they don't have a copy. I’ll create clean HTML with centered styling, maybe with a cursive font for visual appeal, though no header is necessary.
**Creating HTML with MathJax**

The request is to use MathJax, but the only number present is 4, which I can leave as is. I need to ignore any partially cut-off lines, including what seems to be a signature at the bottom. The closing "Mit den besten Grüßen Ihr" should be complete, and it has the German sharp S, "ß". I’ll keep the HTML simple by creating a container with a handwriting-like font using a cursive stack in CSS, and I’ll add body styling with margins and a background texture. Line breaks will be included as needed.
