**Crafting the HTML structure**

I'm working on writing "die bloss kurz" without any cross-out, focusing on line seven to include "werden, k√∂nnen." I want to organize the HTML with specific styling like "Times New Roman" and line-height adjustments. Using a simple structure, I'll incorporate <div class="line"> and Mathjax for \( \zeta \). It's important to underline "XI" and potentially "IV," while ensuring things like "scheinbar" remain plain. Let's finalize this design!
