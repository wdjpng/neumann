**Crafting letter styling**

I'm thinking we should present this as a letter fragment. On the left, we have "congress." followed by a few blank lines, and then on the right, "Yours most cordially." I see there’s a concern about whether the lines are partially cut off. The snippet shows only "congress." but it looks like it's not cut, just cropped at the edges. For the styling, I want to use a typewriter look with CSS. Maybe a container width of around 900px, and a font size of about 20px?
**Setting the letter style**

I’m focusing on setting the style for our letter to have a typewriter look. For the "congress." text, I want it left-aligned, with around 40px of vertical space afterward. Then, for "Yours most cordially," I think about aligning it to the right, possibly with a significant left indentation. According to the image, it starts around two-thirds across; I can achieve this with a div set to text-align: right and a margin-left. I’ll create a class "indent" with a 55% margin to get it close to that right alignment, but not too strict.
**Building the HTML structure**

I'm thinking of using a container with a width of 800px and indenting to 55%. It's essential to ensure proper line breaks. I'll put "congress." in a paragraph with a monospace font and add some empty paragraphs for spacing. Then, I'll include another paragraph styled with margin-left: 55% for "Yours most cordially." 

Now, for the HTML structure, I'll include the head with meta tags and styles. They mentioned using MathJax for math rendering, but since there's no math involved, I might skip that to keep it simple. However, including the style is a must!
**Designing a letter-style layout**

I think we should set the container's background to a "paper" color to mimic a letter feel. The user wants a pretty HTML design that replicates the header. For the body, I could use a wrapper with background color #f2e9dc, resembling beige paper in a subtle way. 

I'll create a "letter" container, around 1000px wide with a background of #efe5d0, adding a slight shadow along with top and bottom padding. The text color should be #555, with slight letter spacing. 

For the content, I’ll structure it with the two lines: "congress." followed by a spacer and "Yours most cordially." I believe I'll be setting the line height to about 36px to ensure everything looks good!
