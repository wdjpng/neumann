**Considering empty output options**

Hmm, they asked to "transcribe all text," but if there's none, should I output an empty body or just a note? It seems I could use a blank HTML document. I want to keep it simple, maybe with a paper background and no text, while adhering to their requirement. I might go with a minimal HTML skeleton, including an empty `<pre>` tag to show that there's no text, keeping everything straightforward.
**Finalizing HTML output**

To ensure compliance, I need to provide strictly HTML code. I’m considering how to structure it: a simple HTML document with necessary elements, but I’ll skip comments since they could add extra text not in the image. I think I'll go with an empty `<pre>` tag and set up a style for font and spacing. There's no need for MathJax if there are no mathematical expressions. I’ll finalize with this clean HTML setup.
