**Formatting a letter**

I need to make the letter visually appealing, starting with the header "Dear von Neumann." I want to use a monospace typewriter style and ensure proper indentation with a left margin. The body should follow standard letter formatting, with 4 spaces added to the start of the second line and the first paragraph beginning with a larger indent of 5 spaces. I’ll apply CSS to create a typewriter effect and maintain simple aesthetics, keeping it minimal with HTML code.
**Designing a letter container**

I want to create a container with a max-width and centered alignment, using a background color like #f5f0e6 to mimic paper. I’ll add a subtle border and drop shadow to enhance the overall appearance. They mentioned using MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions; however, since there’s no math in this case, I might leave out the MathJax script to avoid unnecessary external calls. I’ll ensure to preserve formatting using a `<pre>` element and replicate the header with a typewriter look for a polished finish.
**Styling the letter content**

I’ll use `<pre class="letter">` to preserve the spacing as shown in the original content. To make it visually appealing, I’ll style the `<pre>` tag with appropriate formatting. I need to carefully transcribe the letter, keeping the line breaks and spaces intact. For indentation, I’ll approximate about 5 spaces for the second line and include 4 spaces before key lines like "You are right...". Each subsequent line should be flush left, but I must still insert manual line breaks as indicated in the reference text.
**Preparing letter formatting**

I want to keep the letter exactly as shown across multiple lines. I'll format it starting with "Dear von Neumann," followed by a line break. After that, I'll include the text "You are right..." with an indentation of 4 spaces, indicating a new paragraph right after the salutation. There won’t be an extra blank line; instead, I'll ensure immediate indentation for clarity. The spacing should have double spaces after each period, aligning perfectly with the reference content. Let's put this all together!
**Creating the HTML structure**

I need to implement the text exactly as specified, ensuring that "August-September" is hyphenated correctly and "20th" is formatted properly. I'll enclose the content within a styled `<pre>` tag placed inside a container that may include a header since this is a letter chunk. 

I’ll format the HTML to include the essential styles: a body background, container styles, and `<pre>` styles with a font like 'Courier Prime' for that typewriter feel. I also want to add a centered card display with a drop shadow for an appealing look. Let’s finalize the HTML!
