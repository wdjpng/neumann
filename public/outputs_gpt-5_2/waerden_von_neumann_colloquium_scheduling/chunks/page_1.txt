**Structuring line chunks**

I need to ensure we include entire lines in our chunks. It seems that choosing large vertical bands will allow for good overlaps if necessary, so I’ll outline the sections accordingly. I aim for up to eight lines per chunk, like the date, address, body, closing, and signature, with specific y-coordinates in mind. I’ll estimate the ranges visually from the image to organize everything neatly without overlapping important parts.
**Defining chunk dimensions**

For the closing line "Yours most cordially," I’m setting the y-coordinates to about 700 to 800. The signature will go from 860 to 980. I want to keep the chunks organized, making sure we don’t exceed more than 10 in total. I’m mindful of overlaps, especially since the body could stretch above the bounds. I’ll map out y-coordinates generously to avoid issues while ensuring everything fits within the image dimensions of 768 by 1059. I'll define chunks accordingly!
**Ensuring line containment**

I need to remember that "every single line of text must be fully contained in one chunk," meaning each line should appear in only one chunk. Overlaps may be necessary, especially since the date lines are only in chunk 1 and the body lines are in chunk 3. The closing begins around y  710, and since that overlaps with the body chunk, I might need to allow overlaps to ensure the closing line is fully contained without violating the guideline.
**Clarifying chunk rules**

It looks like overlaps and duplicates are okay as long as each line is fully contained within a chunk. I'm thinking it might be best not to include the closing line within the body chunk since the boundaries can be tricky. I could try setting the body chunk’s upper limit at 730 to stay above the closing. But given the uncertainty, I’ll go for larger bands with overlaps to be safe. The instruction about keeping around eight lines in each chunk is flexible, so I'll aim to keep the lines between 380 and 770.
**Finalizing vertical positions**

I’m re-evaluating the vertical positions for various parts of the letter. The date line is around 90, the address block between 200 and 300, and "Dear von Neumann," near 330. The body extends from 370 to 600, while "Yours most cordially" is about 675, maybe 720. I’ll finalize my boundaries to ensure the coordinates cover everything properly, allowing for some overlap while meeting the eight-line requirement. Alright, here are the final output lines:

(0, 40, 767, 150)  
(0, 150, 767, 360)  
(0, 360, 767, 680)  
(0, 660, 767, 760)  
(0, 780, 767, 980)  
(768, 1059)
