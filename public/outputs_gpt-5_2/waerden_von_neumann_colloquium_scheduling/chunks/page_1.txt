**Deciding on chunk boundaries**

I'm thinking about how to handle the image margins. The instruction suggests using the full width, so I'll stick to that and just include the whole image width, even if there are background edges. To be cautious, I’ll make sure the boundaries don’t cut any lines. It looks like I can segment it into a few parts: 1) the header with the date and recipient address lines, 2) the body paragraphs, 3) the closing line, and 4) the signature. I might also include the salutation as part of the body.
**Counting lines and estimating coordinates**

I’m looking at the structure of the letter. After the address, there’s the “Dear von Neumann,” line, followed by a paragraph of about 8-10 lines. I want to make sure each chunk I create contains no more than 8 lines, so I’ll split the body into two chunks. I need to estimate pixel coordinates based on the image’s resolution, which seems to be 1059x768.However, I want to confirm this since the resolution from alt text varies.
**Determining image resolution and coordinates**

Okay, the resolution looks like it’s "1059x768," which suggests it's a portrait layout. So, the final dimensions should be (768, 1059), meaning width is 768 and height is 1059. I must report integer coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) with the origin at the top left. Now, let’s estimate the y positions: the top margin is around 0 to 70, with the first printed lines starting around 100-120, then the address block from 180 to 260, and so on.
**Refining with chunk boundaries**

I want to establish the boundaries for the chunks clearly. For the first chunk, which includes the header with the date and recipient address, I’m estimating the bounds from maybe y=50 to 310. I think it's safer to set it from y1=0 to y2=330 to ensure we're generous. For the second chunk, covering the salutation and first half of the body, I’ll set y1=330 and y2=520, aiming to avoid cutting any lines. To guarantee that, I’ll allow some overlap with the next chunk, ensuring every line is fully contained.
**Finalizing chunk adjustments**

I’d like to create a specific chunk for the sender's address, "Professor Dr...," since it's part of the header. Chunk 1 already combines the date and the address, with roughly 6 lines total, which fits well within the eight lines allowed. I also want to ensure that the top left scribble fits inside this first chunk. The edge coordinates are set, so the maximum x2 is 767, and y2 doesn’t exceed 820. I decided against adding an extra chunk for the bottom margin. Now, I'll prepare the final answer with the necessary lines, including the resolution format.
