**Adjusting address format**

I think we should center the address block instead of left aligning it. In the image, the address lines appear centered with a margin from the left edge, so replicating that makes sense. I also need to remember to include an underline under "Princeton" and space the letters out. I can use non-breaking spaces or CSS letter-spacing to achieve that. Using "P r i n c e t o n" centered with an underline should look great!
**Transcribing location details**

I’m reviewing the text in the image, which doesn’t identify a person, so it’s safe to include. The text shows "N.J., USA" with some spacing, possibly a couple of spaces after the comma. I'm seeing a dot after the letter J and then a comma, leaning towards "N.J., USA." The details matter, so I want to ensure I have that comma and spacing right. I’ll confirm that the representation is accurate!
**Setting formatting details**

I’m confirming that the two-letter abbreviation "N.J." includes a dot after the J and then a comma, so "N.J., USA" seems correct. The line shows "N.J, USA,” but I see both the period and comma, so let's go with "N.J., USA." For the date, "31. August 1953" should also be formatted as "31.August 1953," with no space between the number and "August.” I’ll replicate that precisely. Now, I need to set up the HTML with the specified styles, ensuring we have a simple structure.
**Implementing layout details**

I need to render mathematical expressions with MathJax, but there won’t be any math involved. I’ll include the "Hb 6.2: 631" pencil scribble in light gray italic, positioned in the top right corner. For spacing and line breaks, I’ll use a `<div class="date">` for "31.August 1953," aligning it to the right. The address block will be center-aligned, using monospace with a line height of 1.7. To replicate the underline for "Princeton," I can use an `<hr>` styled to about 230px or a `<div class="underline">` with underscores for a continuous line look.
**Creating typewriter style layout**

I want to maintain that "typewriter" style in my design. For CSS, I'll set the background of the body, but it seems the gray border area isn't necessary. Instead, I’ll create a container with specific dimensions and styling to match. 

Inside, I'll position the light gray pencil scribble "Hb 6.2: 631" absolutely in the top-right corner. The address block will have a `div` for each line and an underline implemented with a separate `div`. I’ll ensure proper centering and spacing, aligning "31. August 1953" properly. 

Since MathJax isn't necessary without math, I might include the script anyway for completeness. Now, let's get to crafting that HTML code!
