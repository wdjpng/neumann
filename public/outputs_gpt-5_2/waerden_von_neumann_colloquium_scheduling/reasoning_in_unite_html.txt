**Reviewing formatting guidelines**

I realize we shouldn’t change the wording and must replicate it exactly, including capitalization. The second file appears to use two spaces at the start of lines in a pre-wrap style. However, they also want to synthesize a single consistent formatting for the main body of the letter. I can convert it into paragraphs with typical formatting, while keeping the content intact. Notably, the text includes double spaces after periods, which is typical for typewriting.
**Ensuring content preservation**

I need to be careful not to alter the letter's content. Converting it to paragraphs might inadvertently remove double spaces, but the instruction is clear about keeping the wording intact. Double spaces are considered formatting, but to be safe, I can keep them after periods. If I use normal whitespace, browsers could collapse multiple spaces unless I apply white-space: pre-wrap. Since consistent formatting is crucial, I'll maintain that while ensuring readability. I'll also unify the fonts to "Courier New" for the header.
**Finalizing letter format**

I’m going to adopt the header style from the first file, using "Courier New" and setting the font-family to include "Courier New", Courier, and monospace for consistency. The header will have the date right-aligned, and the address centered with appropriate spacing. I need to create one HTML file that includes the entire letter, ensuring that duplicate occurrences, like "congress," are removed. I'll include a closing line, possibly "Yours most cordially," and right-align the closing with consistent indentation using CSS. I still need to decide where to place "Dear von Neumann," too.
**Structuring the letter content**

After the header, I’ll include a vertical gap and have "Dear von Neumann," on its own line. The header will be left mostly unchanged. I'll include the signature exactly as given: "(B.L. van der Waerden)." Additionally, I should note the sender's address, but it may not be necessary. The empty "sheet" can be omitted as well. I’ll make sure to include the "pencil" notation 'Hb 6.2: 631'. Finally, I’ll prepare the HTML code with a unified CSS design, aiming for consistent formatting throughout the letter.
**Finalizing content and code**

I need to ensure we include "Institute of Advanced Study" exactly as provided, even if it seems incorrect. I'll keep the spacing as "N.J., USA" with the appropriate format. The closing line will be "Yours most cordially," and I should avoid adding extra punctuation. I'll include a `<div class="closing">` for better semantics and focus on producing a single HTML file with a consistent design. The CSS will set the body’s background and ensure all text uses "Courier New." Finally, I'll double-check to replicate the text accurately and incorporate the letter’s key details, like the date and congress mention.
