  "summary": "Von Neumann sends Weyl a preliminary manuscript on Hermitian operators, describing his work on eigenvalue representation and the discovery of an operator that admits no such representation. He also presents an observation about the 2+1-dimensional Lorentz group and its infinite-dimensional irreducible representation, asking whether methods exist to control such representations.",
