  "summary": "Von Neumann sends Weyl a preliminary manuscript on Hermitian operators, describing his resolution of eigenvalue representation questions and discovery of an operator without eigenvalue representation. He also discusses an observation about the 2+1-dimensional Lorentz group being represented by conformal mappings of the unit circle, which admits an infinite-dimensional irreducible representation in Hilbert space.",
