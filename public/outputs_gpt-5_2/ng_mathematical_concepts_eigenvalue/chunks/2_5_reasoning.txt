**Transcribing a text excerpt**

I’m checking whether the first line is partially cut off. It seems like I initially thought it was, but after a closer look, it’s fully present. The line starts with "Stattdessen" and continues with phrases like "führt man diese Sätze in e-," and I'm trying to decipher if there's more to follow. It looks like there might be references to "entsprechende" or "äquivalente," but I'm not completely sure about the text's clarity. I need to verify each word carefully!
**Deciphering text more clearly**

Alright, I’m taking another careful look at the lines. Line 2 starts clearly with "benziche über," leading me to think it might be "in eine entsprechende über." Moving on to the next line, I see "Abbildung des Hilbertschen Raumes auf," which is clear. For line 4, it features "sich selbst - u.s.w. eine unitäre, dann." Then line 5 points to "zeigt leicht das Vorhandensein der Darstellungs-Eigenschaft.” I’m getting it now, and line 6 confirms "stellungs-Eigenschaft," while line 7 ends with "Irreduzibilität." Everything seems to be coming together!
**Transcribing remaining lines**

Line 8 clearly states, "Gibt es Methoden, um die unendlichen," and I'm pleased with that clarity! Moving to line 9, it reads "vieldimensionalen irreduziblen Darstel-," which matches perfectly. Line 10 continues with "lungen einer solchen Gruppe zu be-," and line 11 ends in "herrschen?" Now, about line 12, it seems to be partially cut off at the bottom, but since the instruction is to ignore cut-off lines, I’ll stop transcription at "herrschen?" I think there's probably an em dash after the question mark, but it's best to stick to the guidelines!
**Finalizing transcription details**

Looking at line 10, I see there's a long dash at the end, so it reads "beherrschen? —." It appears there's a hyphen after "zu be-" in line 9, then the question in line 10. Now, reviewing the earlier lines, I need to finalize the first two lines. Line 1 has a crossed-out word that looks like "Projektion," but it could also be interpreted as "Substanz." I'm still trying to be precise about the first word; it seems to start with "St" and ends with something scratched out, maybe "Strecke," but "stattdessen" seems to be overlapping as well!
**Transcribing text with considerations**

I’m thinking about how to handle the crossed-out text. I can use HTML to indicate it with a strike-through. I should transcribe accurately what's visible, and for anything unreadable, maybe I can use brackets like "[unleserlich]." For the lines, it seems like "führt man diese f's in ebensolche über, ist also eine lineare Abbildung des Hilbertschen Raumes auf sich selbst." The earlier crossed-out term could be "Substitution," but I wonder if it's something else, like "transforma." I want to ensure I capture everything as clearly as possible!
**Transcribing mathematical text carefully**

I need to find the best way to handle the uncertain parts of the text. Instead of using an ellipsis or other unclear methods, I'll go for brackets like "[unleserlich]" to represent any unreadable sections. The core sentence I want to transcribe seems grammatically correct, like "führt man diese f's in ebensolche über." I should also maintain the formatting while ensuring clarity.

Some lines I've confirmed look good, like "ist also eine lineare Abbildung des Hilbertschen Raumes auf sich selbst." So I will format it in proper HTML while ensuring to capture the original intent!
**Preparing HTML for transcription**

I think writing "führt man diese f's" is the way to go, considering this document likely comes from a 1930s German mathematician using "f" for functions. This choice feels better than leaving it unknown. Now, I'll prepare the HTML and make sure it has a nice letter style.

Since the user wanted MathJax for rendering but there aren't any expressions, I’ll simply focus on clean HTML code without any extra formatting. I’ll also ensure to include the em dash at the end of the last line. Let's finalize everything!
