I'm analyzing the text and I'm getting caught up in the details. The third line might look complete, but I'm not sure if it's fully visible since the next part might be cut off. There’s a potential word “individuelle” that I think is likely correct. I also wonder about the formatting and the historical aspect, which is important for transcription. So, I aim to transcribe the exact text while noting uncertainties as needed. I need to double-check everything carefully!
I'm focusing on producing the recognized text in HTML, and I know accuracy is essential. So, I’m carefully reading the first line: it says, “ein - eindeutig dargestellt (freilich gebrochen)." I see “gebrochen” clearly and wonder if “freilich” fits in the parentheses, meaning "of course." It seems to translate as "albeit broken." The words appear to be hyphenated, which makes sense given their arrangement. The phrase translates to "uniquely represented," which is indeed the meaning of “eindeutig.” I've got to get this right!
I'm noticing that there’s likely a hyphen after "ein-" at the line break, which suggests "ein-eindeutig dargestellt" is intended. It may have been spaced as "ein - eindeutig," but historically, "ein-eindeutig" emphasizes a unique one-to-one mapping, which translates to "eineindeutig" in German. I realize this means "one-to-one" representation, fitting a mathematical context. So, the first line reads, "ein-eindeutig dargestellt (freilich gebrochen)." I’m also considering how the second line begins with "Diese Stufe besitzt nun eine unendlich-" which likely continues on the next line.
It seems the second line continues with "unendlich-vieldimensionale," meaning "infinitely many dimensional." That fits perfectly! So, the second line starts with, "Diese Stufe besitzt nun eine unendlich-" and then shifts to the next line with “vieldimensionale und indivisible Dar-,” but I wonder if "indivisible" was wrongly interpreted. It might be "individuelle" instead. There’s a chance “und ins übliche Dar-” is right here, meaning "into the usual representation." The visible letters look like "ins übliche," which could connect nicely to "Darstellung" meaning "representation." I've got a clearer direction now!
I'm interpreting the text to read: "Diese Stufe besitzt nun eine unendlich-vieldimensionale und ins übliche Dar-," which flows into the phrase "and into the usual rep-." I’m questioning the grammar slightly here, wondering if "und ins übliche Darstellung" feels right since "ins" is a contraction of "in das." The previous line's context fits nicely with "ein-eindeutig dargestellt (freilich gebrochen)." 

I realize I need to present this accurately in HTML format. I’ll maintain a handwritten style within a nicely formatted, centered container, ensuring I stick to the original layout and line breaks. 

Let’s recap the transcription:
Line 1: "ein-eindeutig dargestellt (freilich gebrochen)."
Line 2: "Diese Stufe besitzt nun eine unendlich-"
Line 3: "vieldimensionale und ins übliche Dar-"

Now it’s time to create that HTML!
