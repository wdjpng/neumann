**Constructing HTML for MathJax**

I need to focus on building a minimal HTML skeleton with a MathJax configuration. The output should only include the HTML code itself, without any markdown wrappers. I typically start with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and include the MathJax script from the CDN. In the body, I plan to center an equation in LaTeX format: `f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x_n z^n`. It's essential to note that the index variable 'n' should be included, even though the original might not have mentioned it clearly.
**Writing Valid LaTeX Equation**

I see that the image has a superscript "∞" above the summation symbol and a "0" below. The index usually appears with terms like "x_n z^n," suggesting an index of n, but it doesn't specify that. It's standard to write \sum_{0}^{\infty} x_n z^n, which is valid. I decided to use f(z) = \sum_{0}^{\infty} x_n \, z^n, sticking with f(z) rather than f(ζ). 

I'll focus on styling the header by centering the equation and giving it a handwritten feel to make it visually appealing.
**Creating HTML with MathJax**

I'm going to create the HTML now. First, I'll include the proper meta tags. The minimal CSS can set the body background to resemble parchment, but that might not be necessary. 

The main goal is to transcribe the equation from the image into HTML. I'll include the MathJax script to render it, specifically this line: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>`. 

I'll use the display style for the equation: 

```html
<div class="equation">$$ f(z) = \sum_{0}^{\infty} x_n\, z^n $$</div>
```

I'll also add CSS to center it. I’ll make sure there’s no unnecessary text in the final output.
