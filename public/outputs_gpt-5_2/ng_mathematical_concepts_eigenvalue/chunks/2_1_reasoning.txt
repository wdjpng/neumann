**Designing minimal HTML**

I’m working on a phrase, “ordne ich die,” which has lines that will need to be arranged in a simple HTML format. It should include divs for paragraphs, and I wonder if a cursive font could replicate handwriting. While I want to make it visually appealing, I'll stick with a serif font and proper spacing as CSS, since they’ve requested pretty but minimal. MathJax should be included to render correctly, ensuring no cut-off lines are visible in the output.
**Creating simple HTML**

I’m working on crafting simple HTML to include a MathJax script. I plan to style the body with "Times New Roman" font, appropriate margins, and a light parchment background. I’ll wrap the text in a div class called "letter" with an italic style for a handwritten effect, using line breaks as needed. I want to ensure proper display for umlauts, including <meta charset="utf-8">. I'll keep CSS minimal but aim for a note-like appearance; no code fences around it, just clean presentation.
