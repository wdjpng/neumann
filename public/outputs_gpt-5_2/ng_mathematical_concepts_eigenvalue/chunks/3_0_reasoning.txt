**Transcribing German handwriting**

I need to OCR this German handwritten text. The user mentioned I can ignore lines that are partially cut off, which is key here. The image shows the lower part of a letter in German cursive, and I'll do my best to transcribe it accurately even though it's tricky. 

It starts with something like "im Namen meiner Eltern, für Ihre lieben." However, since the first word is cut off on the left, I must remember to ignore that, as per the user's instruction.
**Clarifying the transcription**

I see that the first word "im" might be partially cut off, but the entire line is visible, so it begins properly. The instruction is to ignore partial lines, and the top line is fully intact.

The first line reads: "im Namen meiner Eltern, für Ihre lieben." It might end with "lieben" rather than "liebe." The second line is likely "für Ihre lieben Wünsche danke," and could continue with "danke ich." The next part seems to continue with "verbleibe ich Ihr sehr ergebener," which is split across lines, showing "ner." I'll keep focusing on the continuity of the text!
**Analyzing the address and signature**

The text shows "verbleibe ich Ihr sehr ergeben-" continuing with "ner." After that, there's the signature line: "J. v. Neumann," which looks right with accents.  

The address appears to be in Budapest, likely "Budapest - Svábhegy, I. p. Eötvös út 15." It could read "Svábhegy." The term "I." indicates a district, and I think it might also be written as "I/b" or "I. ker." which are common formats in Budapest. So, the final address could be "Budapest - Svábhegy, I/b. Eötvös út 15."  Let's double-check that!
**Decoding the transcription choices**

I'm deciding on how to transcribe "I/b," which may appear with a slash, but the image shows just "I/b." I'll stick with that format since we need to transcribe as accurately as possible.

For the earlier line, "Wünsche danke," I need to consider the grammar. It should be "für Ihre lieben Wünsche danke." Although "Wünschen danke" could work in dative, the phrase "für Ihre lieben Wünsche danke" is acceptable, especially if "ich" follows later. He indeed wrote "für Ihre lieben Wünsche danke," which makes sense with the next line being "verbleibe ich Ihr sehr ergeben."  Everything seems to fit together well!
**Formatting the letter in HTML**

I’m preparing to format the text as requested. The content includes: 

"im Namen meiner Eltern, für Ihre lieben  
Wünsche danke,  
verbleibe ich Ihr sehr ergeben-  
ner  
J. v. Neumann. Budapest – Svábhegy, I/b. Eötvös út 15."

I need to check for an end-of-line comma after "Wünsche danke," and format it in HTML with a cursive-like font. I’ll keep it elegant using minimal CSS, replicating the handwriting feel.

I’ll ensure proper line breaks maintain the original layout and manage spacing with CSS. I’m also ensuring the German umlaut "ö" and the en dash "–" are properly included. Here’s the final HTML code: 

```html
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://mathjax.org/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
<style>
body { background: parchment; }
.letter { width: auto; font-family: 'Segoe Script', 'Lucida Handwriting', 'Brush Script MT', cursive; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="letter">
<p>im Namen meiner Eltern, für Ihre lieben<br>
Wünsche danke,<br><br>
verbleibe ich Ihr sehr ergeben-<br>
ner</p>

<p class="signature">J. v. Neumann.</p>

<p class="address">Budapest &ndash; Svábhegy, I/b. Eötvös út 15.</p>
