**Chunking handwritten text**

I need to create bounding boxes for the image, breaking it into 2-10 rectangular chunks. Each chunk should have no more than 2-4 lines of mathematical expressions and 3-4 lines of equations, focusing on the primarily handwritten German text. The page may contain lines like the formula y = ε (x - a)/(1 - ā x) |ε|=1, |a|<1. I think splitting the page into three vertical segments capturing the top, middle, and bottom thirds, while ensuring to include the full letter page width, is the way to go!
**Adjusting bounding box coordinates**

The image has margins, and I can set x1 close to the left edge of the page rather than using the entire image. I should include the whole width of the letter page while taking into account the left and top margins. The page doesn't utilize the entire image, so I will capture from a small x value near the right edge. Oh, I'm realizing the resolution information of 1016 x 768 seems reversed. Typically, that would imply a height of 1016 and a width of 768. I need to be careful with that!
**Clarifying image resolution**

It seems the image resolution is likely 768x1016, which suggests a portrait orientation because the width is smaller than the height. However, the "resolution 1016 768" notation is confusing. It might indicate a width of 1016 and height of 768, implying landscape. I need to be certain, as the displayed image typically shows portrait. The cropping coordinate examples are tricky too. I should clarify the original image resolution before finalizing the output on width and height!
**Understanding cropping and dimensions**

Let's check the information: The link mentions cropping as "look 256," referring to coordinates within the 1016x768 resolution. The height seems to be 1016, and the width is 768, creating a taller, portrait-style image with a ratio of about 1.32, which matches our expectations. The prompt listing "resolution 1016 768" probably means height first. I'll go with the final output of (768, 1016). Now, I need to decide how to split the chunks since there are around 12-14 text lines, including a header, paragraphs, and an equation at the bottom.
**Establishing chunk boundaries**

I need to make sure the lines in the image are not slanted and include full lines, even overlapping chunks if necessary. I’ll target about 3 or 4 chunks, maybe starting with a header and first two lines together. The approach I’m considering is to create three vertical strips with overlaps of about 40 px to ensure that no lines are cut off. I'll set the y coordinates for each chunk carefully, making sure to capture the entire page width without cropping important content. For the final output, I’ll provide (768, 1016) for the resolution!
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I want to refine the x boundaries to ensure they encompass the entire page width. I'll set x1 to 0 and x2 to 767 full image width to capture backgrounds too. I’ll define three bounding boxes:

1) (0, 0, 767, 350) 
2) (0, 330, 767, 620) 
3) (0, 600, 767, 1015) 

This means the equation will be fully contained within chunk three, ensuring it’s not split. I’m checking the line counts too; every chunk should have no more than eight lines of text. With the overlaps set, I feel confident in producing the final output of these bounding boxes and the resolution (768, 1016)!
