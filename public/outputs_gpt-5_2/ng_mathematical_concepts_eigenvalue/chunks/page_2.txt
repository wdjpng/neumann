**Clarifying image dimensions**

I need to carefully consider the image orientation. It’s labeled as portrait with dimensions of 1016 width and 768 height, but that feels reversed since portrait height should be greater than width. However, if the resolution is really 1016 by 768, then I might be misinterpreting it. The screenshot is showing a vertical page, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the width label as referring to the height of the original page. I'll inspect the image further to clarify dimensions and bounding boxes.
**Defining chunk dimensions**

I need to follow the instruction about including the whole width of each letter page. I’m supposed to set the left margin of the letter page area as x1, but to be safe, I should consider the entire image width. The mention of only one page confirms I won't have to manage multiple pages. However, including the whole image width might bring in extra background areas, which should be acceptable. I need to ensure not to split equation lines, and I’ll plan three chunks to capture the relevant portions accordingly.
**Setting chunk coordinates**

I need to ensure that I’m not splitting any text lines across chunks, which can be tricky since estimating the y positions is not straightforward. To avoid this, I’ll allow for some overlap between chunks, maybe 20 to 40 pixels, to ensure full lines are captured. I’ll determine the top margin y, which seems to be around 40, with actual writing starting around y 76. For the x range, I think I should cover the entire width of the page, starting at x 0 to x 1016, to be safe. I'll make sure to format the coordinates correctly, focusing on integers.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

Since there are no explicit specifications, I’ll assume inclusive coordinates are the way to go. I’m debating whether to set x2 as 1015 or 1016, considering it might be better to use a value less than the width for indexing. I’ll go with (1016, 768) for resolution, but to be safer, I’ll opt for x2=1015 and y2=767. 

For my proposed chunks: Chunk 1 will be (0, 0, 1015, 260) to capture the top six lines. Chunk 2 will be (0, 240, 1015, 520), overlapping with Chunk 1 by 20 pixels, and Chunk 3 will capture the equations at (0, 500, 1015, 767), ensuring again that overlaps retain full lines. I’ll also keep in mind to limit mathematical expressions to two to four lines as suggested, focusing on the main equation and any additional text.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I need to clarify the math expressions on the line, making sure they fit within the guidelines. We also need to ensure that no more than eight lines of text are included in each chunk. Since chunks one and two contain around seven lines each, while chunk three has about five lines, we seem good there. To include the entire width of each letter page, I guess I should set x1 around 50 and x2 up to 965, but it's safer to use the full image width. 

Here’s what I’m proposing:
- Chunk 1: (0, 0, 1015, 255)
- Chunk 2: (0, 235, 1015, 520)
- Chunk 3: (0, 500, 1015, 767)
- Final resolution line: (1016, 768)

Coordinates will be strictly integers as specified!
