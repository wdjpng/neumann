**Transcribing German text**

I'm working on transcribing handwritten German text into HTML while preserving formatting. The image shows horizontal lines, where I need to keep line breaks and ignore any partially cut-off lines. The first recognizable words seem to be "Stellung: Nämlich:". The next lines might include "dem Punkte x0, x1, x2, ...", and "vieldimensionalen unitären (Hilbertschen)". I’m noting that the German context might suggest the term "Raum." I must focus on accurately transcribing only the fully visible words.
**Transcribing German text details**

I'm identifying the first line, which looks like "Stellung: Nämlich:". I see there's a dot after "Stellung" — it's evident. The second line reads something like "dem Punkte x0, x1, x2, ...", and I need to double-check that it follows German grammar correctly since "dem Punkte" fits the dative singular. Then the phrase continues with "des unendlich-" and carries on to the next line with "vieldimensionalen unitären (Hilbertschen)". I’ll also ensure to render math variables using MathJax.
**Formatting the math expressions**

I need to wrap the variables x0, x1, x2, ... in the LaTeX format \(x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots\) using MathJax. To render these mathematical expressions, I’ll need to include a MathJax script tag in the HTML head. The formatting should stay close to the original, including line breaks, and we should aim for a simple HTML layout. I might style it with a cursive font in grey ink for a handwritten look, while ensuring not to include any partially cut-off lines from the screenshot.
**Crafting the text for HTML**

Great, there’s no text cut off — that’s a relief! I’ll write the precise text lines now. For Line 1, it’ll be "Stellung. Nämlich:", noting that there's a dot after "Stellung." Line 2 will read "dem Punkte \(x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots\) des unendlich-” using MathJax for the indices. Line 3 will be "vieldimensionalen unitären (Hilbertschen)".

I’ll include the correct umlauts and maintain that dative format. Next, I need to create a simple HTML structure with the MathJax script, plus a centered div styled in an italic Georgia font using <pre> for whitespace preservation. Let's put everything together!
**Finalizing the HTML structure**

I need to include the hyphen at the end of the line to indicate continuation. Plus, I want to ensure I'm using accessible fonts with an italic script. My final HTML will start with `<!DOCTYPE html><html>` and include the MathJax loader from a CDN. They mentioned to only output the HTML code, which is fine since it's okay to include the doctype and head. I'll make sure to add a meta charset of UTF-8. Let’s finalize this!
