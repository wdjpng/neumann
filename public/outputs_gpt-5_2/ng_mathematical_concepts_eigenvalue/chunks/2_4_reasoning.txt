**Transcribing math expressions**

I’m considering that the scribble could actually be "√e", potentially referring to "e^{iθ}". The user wants me to ignore partially cut-off lines and focus just on this snippet, which means I'll need to produce HTML with line breaks and use MathJax for the formulas. For example, I can express it as: 

f(z) → (√{1 - a \bar a} / (1 - \bar a z)) f( (z - a)/(1 - \bar a z) ). 

Still, I want to be cautious about any potential mis-transcriptions.
**Scrutinizing the expression**

I’m contemplating whether I should include "varepsilon" in my transcription, but I don’t want to add anything incorrectly. Looking closely at the image details, the numerator has two radicals: the first starts with a loop shape and a small "e" underneath, while the second covers "1 - a ā" with a bar. The denominator clearly shows "1 - \bar{a} z". So maybe the numerator is "√e √{1 - a \bar{a}}", but I'm also considering if "√e" might actually be scribbled "√2". The glyph looks similar to an epsilon!
**Transcribing the expression clearly**

I'm pondering whether "e-like" could actually be "2," but that would make the numerator '√2 √(1 - a ā)', which feels unnatural. I wonder if the first root could be "√E" instead? It's a bit unclear. Another option is that they wrote "√e √(1 - a ā)" to represent "√(e(1 - a ā))" for clarity. So, I think it's best to transcribe literally as sqrt(e) sqrt(1 - a \bar{a}). 

The full expression then becomes:

f(z) → ( \sqrt{e}\, \sqrt{1 - a \bar{a}} / (1 - \bar{a} z) ) f( (z - a)/(1 - \bar{a} z) ). 

I want to ensure it looks good with MathJax and follows the guidelines!
**Preparing HTML with MathJax**

I need to produce minimal HTML, with just the necessary code for rendering MathJax. The user requested to output only the HTML code, but I think including a small structure that encompasses the necessary MathJax script is essential for displaying the formula correctly.

Here's how I'll structure it:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
<style>
body { font-family: 'Georgia', serif; background:#faf7f0; color:#222; padding:24px; }
.math-line { font-size: 1.35rem; line-height: 1.8; }
.arrow { margin: 0 12px; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="math-line">
$$
f(z)\;\longrightarrow\;\frac{\sqrt{e}\,\sqrt{1-a\bar a}}{1-\bar a\, z}\;f\!\left(\frac{z-a}{1-\bar a\, z}\right)
$$
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

I also need to ensure I'm using \bar{a} for the conjugate. That looks good!
