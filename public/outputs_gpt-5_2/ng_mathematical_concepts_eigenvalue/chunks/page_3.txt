**Calculating image chunking**

I need to split the image into rectangular chunks, using the resolution of 768x1042 (width x height). Checking the metadata shows it as (768, 1042) too. I have to provide coordinates for bounding boxes that cover the lines of mathematical expressions, making sure each chunk contains no more than 2-4 lines. Next, I'll inspect the handwritten content which appears to be in German and contains equations, starting with the top margin and identifying the lines of text.
**Analyzing equations for chunking**

I’m looking at the content, which includes several lines with mathematical expressions like "Σ |xn|^2." I need to segment it to keep no more than 3-4 lines of equations per chunk. I see a centered equation, f(z) = Σ_{0}^\infty x_n z^n, which counts as one display equation line. There’s also a transformation line that might also be regarded as a separate display equation. To organize it well, I should ensure each chunk contains either one or two equations, along with minimal text.
**Planning horizontal slices for layout**

I need to create horizontal slices that cover the full width of the letter page while avoiding splitting lines across boundaries. To do this, I’ll plan for vertical chunks. For the header area, which includes lines like "Stellung: Nämlich:", I think chunk 1 should cover y-coordinates from 30 to 140 and use the full width from 0 to 767. Even though there’s a small border, I'll still include the entire width, ensuring all content is visible. The bottom-right coordinate will be based on this setup, keeping it all within the margins.
**Defining the next chunks**

For the next chunk, I’ll include the paragraph about "den Punkten x0, x1, x2" which will cover lines from around y 140 to y 340, targeting y-coordinates 120-350. It’s essential to ensure the displayed equation f(z) appears after the "Funktion" line, likely around y 250-300. I’m thinking of creating chunk 2 with the text leading up to just above the equation, while chunk 3 will encompass both the equation lines and the text "für die Transformation," since it’s okay to mix text and equations, as long as I adhere to the line constraints.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

For chunk organization, I plan to structure my sections carefully to capture the necessary content. Chunk 2 will include text leading up to "Funktion," ensuring not to split that line. Chunk 3 will capture the equation lines. The following chunks consist of relevant text and questions, with careful attention to boundaries. 

I’ve defined the coordinates for each chunk—ensuring overlaps where necessary, maintaining the specified number of lines for equations, and including the full width as instructed. My final chunks are laid out, making sure all boundaries stay within the image dimensions!
**Outputting final coordinates**

I’m putting together the final coordinate lines for the chunks. Here are the calculated coordinates:

(0, 20, 767, 150)  
(0, 146, 767, 255)  
(0, 245, 767, 430)  
(0, 425, 767, 570)  
(0, 560, 767, 710)  
(0, 700, 767, 840)  
(0, 830, 767, 1015)  
(768, 1042)  

I’ve checked for potential overlaps and ensured nothing is cut off, confirming that all lines are well captured. Since the specifications require integers for the pixel coordinates, I've adhered to that. All is set to finalize the output!
