**Analyzing image chunking**

I need to split the handwritten German math notes into rectangular chunks, keeping each between 2 to 10 chunks and limiting each to 3-4 lines of text. It's crucial to ensure that each line is fully contained, even allowing for some overlap since the lines are slanted. I should include the whole width of each letter page for better readability. The image resolution is 768x1042, confirming that width is 768 and height is 1042.
**Locating text coordinates**

I need to ensure that the coordinates for the chunks of the canvas are whole numbers. I'll visually inspect the page to determine where the text and math expressions are. There's a header and several lines with equations starting from "Funktion" and including expressions like f(z) = Σ x_n z^n. There are also roots, fractions, and trailing text that need to be included. I must split the content into chunks, limiting each to 3-4 lines of math to keep it organized.
**Defining chunk coordinates**

It looks like there are probably about two lines of math, plus maybe a math expression within text. I need to respect the math lines while also including text lines, limiting each chunk to around 6-8 lines. It’s important to include the full width of the page, so I can set horizontal boxes from x=0 to x=768 with small margins. To be cautious, I’ll set the bottom right coordinates at x2=767 and y2=1041, considering zero-indexed limits for the width.
**Determining y splits**

I need to figure out where to make y splits by looking at approximate positions. The top margin is around 0-30 pixels, followed by a few header lines. Then there's text related to math expressions, like "dem Punkte x0, x1..." and "Funktion." After that, there’s an equation f(z) = Σ and a transformation line, followed by more text. The question line "Gibt es Methoden ... zu beherrschen?" appears near the bottom, along with a final line that likely continues onto the next page.
**Setting chunk boundaries**

I need to keep 3-4 lines of equations per chunk, and it seems there are two main equations. I can group them into one chunk with surrounding text. I'm planning my chunk divisions based on y positions. The image height is 1042 pixels, and I estimate the content begins around y=70. 

For chunk boundaries, I'll set:
1) (0, 0, 767, 315) for the header and text leading to "Funktion."
2) (0, 300, 767, 520) for the equations.
3) (0, 515, 767, 780) for the paragraph.
4) (0, 770, 767, 1041) for the questions and final text.

This setup ensures that chunks fit all requirements.
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I've identified overlaps between chunk 1 and 2, as well as between 3 and 4, which is great. I'm questioning if 4 chunks are sufficient, but the key requirement is to keep 3-4 lines of equations per chunk. Chunk 2 contains two equations, and chunk 1 includes one inline expression. To ensure every line is fully contained, I’ll set chunk boundaries as follows: 

1) (0, 0, 767, 340)  
2) (0, 290, 767, 560)  
3) (0, 540, 767, 810)  
4) (0, 790, 767, 1041)  

This structure ensures sufficient overlap while adhering to the rules. The resolution will be (768, 1042).
