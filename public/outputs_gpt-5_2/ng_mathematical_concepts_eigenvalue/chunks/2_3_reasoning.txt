**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe text from an image into HTML while maintaining formatting and ignoring any partially cut-off lines. The image appears to show handwritten German, possibly saying "Für. Die Transformation." I'll need to carefully inspect the snippet, focusing on what's legible. It seems the first word is likely "Für," which has the umlaut. The entire phrase might be "Für Die Transformation" but includes a period after "Für," suggesting it could be punctuation. My goal is to transcribe it exactly as presented.
**Creating an HTML snippet**

It looks like the top edge of the line isn’t cut off, but the left side might be starting from what appears to be "Fü." I should transcribe the text as "Für. Die Transformation," considering the period could also be interpreted as a colon. I want to format this using pretty HTML while ensuring I use MathJax, although there are no math expressions here. I'll create a simple structure with a body that mimics handwriting style, maybe a cursive font, and make sure the text is centered. I'll provide the appropriate HTML snippet without adding anything extra.
**Finalizing HTML output**

I need to keep line breaks to one and I'm deciding against using `<span>` for underlines since it's not necessary. Instead, I'll include `<p>` for paragraph formatting if needed. Now, here’s the HTML structure I want to produce:

I'll begin the document with the correct declarations and ensure the charset is set to UTF-8. I'll make sure to include the MathJax script, although there are no math expressions here. The body will have a background color while the text is styled to mimic handwriting. 

I'll output the structured HTML without heavy formatting and ensure everything adheres to the instructions to provide just the HTML code.
