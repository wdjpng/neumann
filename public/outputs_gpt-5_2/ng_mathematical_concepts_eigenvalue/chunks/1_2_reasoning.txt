**Creating math representation**

I see the image showing "|Îµ| = 1, |a| < 1," with a vertical slash that looks like 'l'. In mathematical notation, it's important to include some spacing before the conditions for clarity. I'll keep that in mind as I produce the final version. I should also remember to ignore any partially cut-off lines, as there aren't any. Okay, I'm ready to finalize the simple HTML.
