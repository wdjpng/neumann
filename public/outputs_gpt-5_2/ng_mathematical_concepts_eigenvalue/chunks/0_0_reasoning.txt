**Planning HTML Structure**

I noticed there's a minor dot on the page, but it’s not worth mentioning since it doesn't impact the text. I want to keep the line breaks from the original, placing "N.G" on the left, "Hs 91: 681" in the center, and "Budapest, den 19.8.1928." on the right. I think using a CSS grid with three zones will help. I'll set up a container around 900 pixels wide, use `display: grid`, and then arrange the items. I'll make sure to style the following line in cursive.
**Designing HTML with MathJax Consideration**

They mentioned using MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions, but it’s not strictly necessary. I could include a minimal script, but since the main focus is on the HTML, I might keep it light. We can safely omit MathJax unless math expressions are present.

I plan to include styles for the body with a subtle paper-like background and a small margin. The grid header will feature "N.G" in an italic calligraphic style. I’ll set specific styles to emulate a dark brown ink color, using suitable fonts for different elements.
**Creating HTML Structure**

Now, I’m focusing on the salutation "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" and planning to style it in a larger cursive font. I want the text to have a grey pencil script look, matching the salutation color. For spacing, I’ll adjust the margin-top to ensure there's space between the header and salutation.

The first grid row will feature the header, while the second will include the salutation with a line break before it. I'll ignore any partially cut lines which may not matter. Now, I'll draft the HTML body structure.
**Writing CSS and Finalizing HTML**

I’m working on the CSS for the page, setting a max-width and using a soft background color to keep things looking nice. I’ll be cautious though, since the app might not support all background styles. However, given the instruction to "make it pretty," I'll lean towards an artistic look. 

I’m double-checking details like the initials and formatting. For "N.G," I’ll go with "N. G" for clarity. I’m also confirming punctuation, opting for "Hs 91: 681" with the proper colon. Now, I’ll finalize the HTML!
**Finalizing HTML with Date and Salutation**

I’m noting down the date as "Budapest, den 19.8.1928," which looks perfect. The salutation will be "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" and the image confirms that the exclamation mark is included. Now, I just need to focus on producing the final HTML. 

I’ll aim to keep the semantics minimal while crafting a clean structure. Let’s get this done and deliver a well-organized HTML output!
