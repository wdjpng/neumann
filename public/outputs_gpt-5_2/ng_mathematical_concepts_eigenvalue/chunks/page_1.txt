**Determining image resolution**

I need to confirm the actual image resolution, which is typically expressed as width x height. The viewer's input indicates a resolution of 1013x768, suggesting height is 1013 and width is 768. However, the page appears portrait, implying the width should be smaller. This is a bit confusing since the standard is usually to show width first. I’ll make sure to clarify this orientation for accuracy. Based on my deductions, I conclude that the width is indeed 768 and the height 1013.
**Setting image coordinates**

I usually consider the width to be smaller at 768 and the height at 1013, so I expect the final line to format as (768, 1013). The origin of the coordinates starts at the top-left (0,0). They mentioned including the full width of the page, so I can set x1=0 and then determine if x2 is 767 or 768. Since it's unclear if the bottom-right coordinate should be inclusive or exclusive, I think I'll play it safe and set x2 to 767 and y2 to 1012.
**Chunking the text**

I’m looking to segment the text into chunks. I want to keep it to no more than eight lines per chunk, and since the page has around 20 lines, I'll split it into three chunks: the header plus the first 6-8 lines, then the middle 6-8 lines, and finally the last 6-8 lines. To make sure all lines are included, I might create four chunks. For the first chunk, I’ll take the header and the first six lines, including the greeting to keep it all within limits.
**Estimating chunk positions**

They prefer that I don’t use more chunks than necessary for the text and especially the header. So, it makes sense to combine the header and the first batch into one chunk. I’ll estimate the y positions starting with the top of the page at y=0. The margin likely ends near y=60 with the header sitting there. The first body line probably starts around y=160. I’ll measure the y coordinates on an imagined grid with a total height of 1013. 

For the header region, I estimate y positions from 30 to 90, and for the first body line, around y=150-190. There are about 15 body lines down to around y=900. I think the first chunk could span from y=0 to 250, which gives me the header and the first four body lines but needs a buffer for slanted lines.
**Creating text chunks**

I will divide the text into four chunks: 

- Chunk 1 spans from y=0 to 270, likely capturing the header and the first two or three lines — not exceeding eight lines, which is acceptable.
- Chunk 2 ranges from y=250 to 520 and includes the next 6-7 lines, with a slight overlap of 40 pixels for safety.
- Chunk 3 will cover y=500 to 780 for the following lines.
- Chunk 4, from y=760 to 1012, will take the last lines.

I've adjusted the coordinates to ensure no lines are cut while including a margin for safety. The final coordinate outputs will be: (0, 0, 767, 270), (0, 250, 767, 520), (0, 500, 767, 780), (0, 760, 767, 1012), and the final resolution (768, 1013).
