**Splitting text lines into chunks**

I need to divide the text into chunks, focusing on the top-left and bottom-right coordinates for each line. We’ve got handwritten German letters here, not math formulas, so the equation constraint isn’t an issue. Still, I want to keep it to about eight lines of text per chunk, while covering the whole width of the letter page. The resolution mentioned is 1013x768, so I think that's width first, then height.
**Clarifying image orientation and resolution**

I’m considering the image orientation, which seems portrait, yet the mentioned resolution of 1013x768 implies landscape. The display resolution is 1013x768, but it feels wrong for a portrait. The descriptive text might be confusing; it's cropping details from the dataset. Previous tasks indicated a resolution format of width first and height second. I need to confirm whether the image is rotated 90 degrees because it's displaying as though the height is greater than the width.
**Determining chunk dimensions and layout**

I’m thinking about the page dimensions: width 1013 seems greater than height 768. It might be that the letter page is oriented diagonally due to cropping in the background. I need to split this into 2-10 chunks, keeping in mind there's a header and multiple body paragraphs. I should ensure to include the entire width of the page, which could be around 60 to 953 on the x-axis. I want to capture the lines fully, allowing overlap between chunks for the wavy lines. I'll need to count the lines carefully!
**Mapping out the letter layout**

There's a header at the top: "N. G" on the left and "Hsg1: 681 Budapest, den 19.8.1928." on the right. That’s two text lines, followed by the salutation "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" and then the body paragraphs. I’m planning to create 5-6 vertical chunks and need to estimate the y coordinate ranges. If the height is 768 px, the letter content likely runs from around y 40 to y 722. It's important that each line is fully contained in its chunk, avoiding any cuts through the text.
**Establishing chunk coordinates**

To ensure no text lines get split, I'm planning generous overlaps with six chunks. Chunk 1 will cover the top header area, including "N.G" and "Hsg1: 681 Budapest, den 19.8.1928," with a height up to y 130. Chunks 2 through 5 will cover various sections of the body paragraphs, with intersections to maintain continuity.

I'll set the x-coordinates from 0 to 1013 to include the entire letter page's width. After finalizing the y-coordinates, I should output:

(0, 0, 1013, 130)  
(0, 110, 1013, 285)  
(0, 270, 1013, 435)  
(0, 430, 1013, 600)  
(0, 585, 1013, 768)  
(1013, 768)
