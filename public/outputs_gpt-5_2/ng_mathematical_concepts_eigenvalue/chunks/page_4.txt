**Evaluating handwritten letter layout**

I need to split the image of a handwritten letter into chunks by text lines, avoiding math expressions. I should keep it to no more than eight lines total. The top half has about 4-6 visible lines, while the lower half is mostly blank, with a single line close to the bottom. I can see three distinct lines in the top half, including a signature line and a place line. I should also consider the full width of the page.
**Determining chunk dimensions and coordinates**

I can create one chunk with the top text lines (up to 8 lines) and another for the single bottom line (the address). I need to ensure I include the entire width and that each line is fully contained, especially since they're a bit slanted; it’s smart to add generous vertical padding. 

The image resolution is 768x1010, so I’ll set the chunk width to be from x1 = 0 to x2 = 767, ensuring I respect the margins. I’m clarifying that I’m using a 0-based inclusive approach.
**Setting chunk coordinates for the letter**

The instructions say coordinates start at (0,0) in the top left, but they don't specify inclusive or exclusive. To be safe, I’ll use x2 and y2 just within the image bounds: 767 for width and 1009 for height. For the first chunk, I’ll capture from around y = 80 to y = 450 to cover 4 lines plus the signature. 

Even though I could split it into two chunks, it seems fine to include that second line about "Budapest..." in the top chunk since we're limited to 8 lines total. Both chunks can include the full width since that aligns with the instructions.
**Deciding on chunk separation for the text**

If I only have one chunk, that's okay, but there's a large blank space after the text. The instructions suggest that I might need to create two chunks: one for the top text and possibly leaving the bottom blank. 

The guidelines say to allow for two to ten chunks, but I don't want to use more than necessary. With around five lines, I could go with one chunk, yet since instructions state to split into a minimum of two, I’ll need to follow that.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates for handwritten letter**

I’ve decided to create two chunks: the first will cover the top four lines, including the closing text and signature, while the second chunk focuses on the single line about "Budapest..." around y 520. 

For chunk 1, I’ll set the coordinates to cover y1=20 to y2=470. The second chunk will be y1=475 to y2=630. I’m ensuring to include the full width from 0 to 767. 

The final coordinates are:
- Chunk 1: (0, 20, 767, 470)
- Chunk 2: (0, 475, 767, 630)
- Resolution: (768, 1010) 

Let’s present those!
