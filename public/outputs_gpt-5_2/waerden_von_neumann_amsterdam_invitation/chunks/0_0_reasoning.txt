**Transcribing text to HTML**

I need to transcribe text to HTML while maintaining formatting and using MathJax for math expressions. The text's source is a letter chunk image, and I have to ignore any lines that are partially cut off. The header "13. Juli 1953" is fully visible, and the salutation and recipient address are clear too. I should produce only HTML text and stylize it to resemble a typewritten letter using a monospaced font. Let’s get started on this transcription!
**Confirming punctuation formatting**

I need to check the punctuation in the line that says "Princeton N.J., U.S.A." The underlined "Princeton N.J." suggests that I'll replicate this with the HTML `<u>` tag. The spacing also matters since the address is positioned on the right half of the document. I'll style the container to align it to the right, which is typical for letters. It seems I might use a wrapper width of about 800 px with left margin set to around 60%. Let's move forward!
**Deciding on included text**

I need to consider whether to include the top-left scribble, "Hs 652: 6529." It's fully visible but may seem extraneous. The instruction is to ignore lines that are partially cut off, and since this one is clear, I think I should include it, especially since it seems like an archive code. It might be best to present it as a faint, small pencil scribble. 

Next, I notice "Mein lieber Prinz," appearing typewritten—it might not be bold, but I'll replicate it as it appears. Let's move forward!
**Transcribing body text**

I’m starting the body with the line: "Sie würden uns eine grosse Freude machen, wenn." This part is fully visible in the screenshot, but the next line is partially cut off, which may go beyond the view of the screenshot. The instructions specify ignoring lines that are partially cut off, so I’ll only include the fully visible line. That means I'll go ahead and transcribe just "Sie würden uns eine grosse Freude machen, wenn." It's great that we can include this full line!
**Addressing diacritics and formatting**

I need to ensure accuracy regarding diacritics, like spelling "grosse" with its old form instead of using "große." The initial "J." in "Professor J. von Neumann" is noted, and I see potential issues with spacing, particularly the double period in "N.J." and the extra spaces before "U.S.A."

For the HTML, I’ll style the container with a font like 'Courier New' to resemble typewriter text while ensuring that elements like the date and address are correctly aligned. Additionally, I'll add the underlining as needed.

I’ll keep formatting minimal and adhere to the instructions to ignore partially cut-off lines. Let’s finalize the HTML!
