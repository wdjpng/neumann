**Designing letter alignment**

I’m working on crafting a right-aligned letter block, considering a container size to replicate the letter's area. I want to keep the text close to the right side with vertical spacing similar to the top lines. The lines include "freundliche Grüsse," "Ihr," and a blank space, followed by "(B. L. van der Waerden)." Using CSS, I plan to set the font to a typewriter style and align the lines closely, maybe to 70% width for better formatting replication.
**Setting up page layout**

I'll create a page area with an 800 px width and place a signoff block aligned to the right, taking up 45% of that width. This arrangement will keep the lines close to the right margin and add vertical space before the right-aligned typed name.

The CSS style will set the background, with a simple container format using Courier New. I’ll also ensure to use "Grüsse" with the umlaut correctly, while keeping in mind that there's no need for mathematical expressions with MathJax here.
**Deciding on capitalization**

I'm trying to figure out the correct spelling for "Grüsse." It seems likely that it should be spelled with the umlaut as "Grüsse." Now, about "Freundliche Grüsse"—there's a possibility that the first letter is lowercase in the image I’m looking at. German typically capitalizes the first letter, but typewritten letters sometimes appear in lowercase. The image makes it tricky since the first letter looks a bit cut off. I'll go with "Freundliche Grüsse," keeping the context in mind.
**Finalizing HTML layout**

I’ve decided to choose "Freundliche Grüsse" with proper spacing and line breaks. I’m crafting a minimal yet nice HTML structure. The page will feature a pleasing background and shadow effects.

I need to ensure that I use the right text alignment for the signoff and signature. Importantly, I'll keep only the HTML, as that’s what was requested. Even though they mentioned rendering mathematical expressions, it doesn’t seem necessary here. I think the design works well, so I’ll finalize and deliver this!
