**Defining text sections**

I need to divide the typed German letter into rectangular text sections. It has a date at the top right, an address block center-right, followed by the salutation, body paragraphs, and closing signature. I'm not dealing with math expressions here, so that constraint isn't relevant.

While I'm limited to around eight lines per chunk, I can include the letter page's full width as long as it's reasonable. I'll set the boundaries near the leftmost (32 px) and rightmost (729 px) edges of the page.
**Clarifying image resolution**

The image resolution is given as 1058x768, but I see that width should actually be 768 and height 1058 based on their description. They want me to create multiple bounding boxes for different text blocks, ensuring to include the full width. The instruction to use the entire width of each letter page suggests that I might set x1 small around 10-30 and x2 near 740. To be cautious, I can set x1 to 0 and x2 to 767, since they say coordinates must be integers.
**Creating text chunks**

I see they want every line of text or mathematical expression fully contained in one chunk. If some lines aren't straight, overlapping chunks is acceptable to ensure coverage. So, I need to separate the date line in the top right, the address block, greeting, body paragraph, closing "Freundliche Grüsse Ihr," and the signature line "(B.L. van der Waerden)." 

I can create five chunks, starting with the date, estimating to place it around y 95. The date should be near the top right around y 110-150, and I’ll include the full width, even if that means mostly filling empty space on the left.
**Deciding on chunk structure**

I need to remember that I shouldn't create more chunks than strictly necessary for the header. It seems like I can combine the date line and address block into one chunk since they’re separated by some vertical space, which could work. However, since they aren’t horizontally aligned and I’ll likely end up with large whitespace in the chunk, I wonder if I should actually create two separate chunks instead. 

I could have one chunk for the date and another for the address block, but I also need to ensure I don’t include any unnecessary empty space. It's a bit of a balancing act!
**Establishing chunk boundaries**

I need to ensure that each line is fully contained within its chunk. Combining both the date and address makes sense since they fall within the y range of about 90 to 350. It's clear I'll need separate chunks, as the salutation "Mein lieber Prinz," along with the first paragraph, adds up to around 11 lines total, which means I need to split them into two chunks to keep within the 8-line limit.

For the chunk placements, I’ll set chunk 1 at roughly y1=60 to y2=360 for the date and address, with subsequent chunks set to include the body and closing remarks. I'll estimate their y-coordinate values carefully, ensuring everything fits and adheres to the required structure.
**Finalizing chunk parameters**

I need to ensure I include the closing "Freundliche Grüsse" and "Ihr" within the right ranges, noting that they fall around y 670-720. My chunk 3 ends at y 700, and chunk 4 begins at y 690, which gives a slight overlap. Also, the last body line should fit within chunk 3, around y 650-670. 

Adjusting my chunk coordinates, I decided to start chunk 1 at y1=0 to include a small scribble at the top left. The finalized chunks will look like this:

1) (0, 0, 767, 350) for date and address.
2) (0, 330, 767, 560) for the salutation and part of the body.
3) (0, 550, 767, 700) for remaining body text.
4) (0, 690, 767, 780) for closing remarks.
5) (0, 820, 767, 950) for the signature.

The resolution is (768, 1058). I believe this setup covers everything as required!
