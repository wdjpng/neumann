**Transcribing empty content**

I need to transcribe what’s on an image, but it looks like a blank beige paper without any visible text. Since there's nothing to actually transcribe, should I still create some minimal HTML? They want just the HTML code, so I guess I'll provide a simple structure with empty lines. Even though it’s styled to look like a blank page, it will essentially be empty. There’s no need for any math rendering here!
**Clarifying HTML output**

I can't add content that isn’t actually present, so I should consider outputting an empty HTML structure. They want HTML code, but if the body is empty, is that enough? I could use a subtle container but can't include text. Comments are HTML code, but I need to follow their instruction to exclude them as well. For formatting, I could use non-breaking spaces, but I might just leave the body empty. 

I’ll structure it nicely with a pretty background!
**Designing minimal HTML**

Since there’s no text to work with, I can be flexible with styles. However, they want me to keep formatting as close to original as possible, which means minimal design. I’ll create a simple HTML document with a styled container.

I'll include the basics like a `DOCTYPE`, `meta` charset, and a title. The body will feature a container styled to maintain appearance, but ultimately, it's empty because there's no content. I'll keep things straightforward and proceed with that!
