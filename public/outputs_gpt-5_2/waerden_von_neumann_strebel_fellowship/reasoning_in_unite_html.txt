**Synthesizing HTML Files**

I need to combine three separate HTML files into one with a unified format for the main body of the letter. There might be duplicates to consider. The header has a scribble note, date, and address block for Professor Dr. J. von Neumann. The greeting says "Dear Von Neumann" and includes content regarding Dr. Kurt Strebel and more details about him as a teacher. I want to ensure the header stays mostly unchanged while ensuring consistent formatting throughout, without altering the letter's content.
**Unifying Format for HTML**

I want to create a cohesive format for the letter by ensuring consistent fonts and line heights. I might consider converting the content into paragraphs and lists instead of using pre and br wrappers. The instructions say to synthesize a single consistent format for the letter body while keeping the header largely unchanged. Importantly, I shouldn't alter the text content, so I need to maintain spellings like "assist e nt" and "S t r e b e l." Even if it seems off, preserving those details is essential!
**Addressing Hyphenation in Letter**

The letter features specific terms like "Privatdozent," "autumn 1953," "Gutachten," and "Habilitationsschrift," which include a hyphenated line break in "publi- cations." Their guideline says to unify formatting without altering the content. I'm wondering if I should preserve the hyphenation as it originally is, even though we usually would join it into "publications." This might be tricky, but it seems crucial to stick to their instruction and keep the content unchanged, even if it's a minor adjustment.
**Maintaining Exact Words**

I need to ensure I keep the exact wording from the letter, including "publi- cations" as it appears. Since I'm merging multiple pages, some hyphens and line breaks are due to earlier formatting. I can reflow into paragraphs but must preserve the original spelling. The hyphen will still remain in the content, and I'll keep "publi- cations" with a space after the hyphen. It may look unusual, but it replicates the original content accurately while adhering to their instructions about not altering anything.
**Unifying Letter Formatting**

I want to make sure I keep all the original wording, like "assist e nt," and the signature details intact, including "B" and "Prof.Dr.B.L.van der Waerden." My task is to merge the contents of multiple pages into one cohesive HTML file while removing duplicates. I see no obvious duplicates in the content itself. I will unify the formatting to ensure consistency, using "Courier New" for the letter's main body and keeping the header and body together. I'll maintain proper indentation and line breaks without adding bullet points, keeping it clean and straightforward!
**Maintaining Line Breaks and Hyphenation**

I need to decide whether to keep the line breaks exactly as they are or to unify formatting by converting them into paragraphs. The original document used pre white-space pre-wrap for line breaks, but creating paragraphs could help improve readability. However, I want to keep the specific hyphenation like "publi- cations" intact. I’ll create blocks for each publication without bullets, maintaining the content while ensuring consistent styling throughout. I'll also preserve spacing, especially in names and important details, such as "Institute of Advanced Study" and the signature format.
**Crafting CSS and Formatting Content**

I'm planning the CSS for the document, setting the body background and fonts. I'll keep the page width at 880px for a clean layout, and ensure that the signature uses Times New Roman in italics. I need to preserve any specific formatting, like the spacing in "S t r e b e l" and the hyphen in "publi- cations". I'll remove any unnecessary scripts and streamline styles for a robust presentation. 

The content will be structured with clear paragraphs and line breaks replicated as needed, ensuring everything appears as intended without altering the original message.
**Finalizing HTML and CSS Code**

I'll ensure the letter retains special characters like 'ä' in "Fläche," since it should be supported with UTF-8. I need to include the line about Dr. Strebel being a lovely teacher along with the request for the application form, maintaining the signature "B" and spacing. The address must have "Institute of Advanced Study" correctly spelled, avoiding any mistakes. 

I’ll write the final code, ensuring everything fits in one HTML skeleton while keeping formatting minimal and excluding any unnecessary analysis. Let's finalize this!
