**Formatting a typewriter-style letter**

I need to use CSS to replicate a typewriter letter. I'll opt for a monospaced font and left-align the paragraphs while adding a slight margin. For the closing, "Yours most cordially," I'll right-align it, mimicking the letter’s style without pushing it fully to the right. I need to ensure that line breaks match the original layout from the image, spacing them out correctly while sticking with CSS conventions.
**Creating the signature layout**

I plan to add a handwritten "B" below, centering it while keeping it aligned with the left margin. Then, I'll right-align the typed signature for "(Prof. Dr. B. L. van der Waerden)" slightly to the left of the right margin. Next, I'll include a left-aligned "enclosure" at the bottom and underline it with CSS. Since the relevant lines are fully visible, I’ll ignore any partially cut-off lines from above. Lastly, I might add the MathJax script tag in the HTML for rendering math expressions, even if it's not necessary.
**Crafting the HTML letter**

I’ll include the MathJax script header to adhere to the instruction about rendering mathematical expressions, even if there aren't any present. While it might be overkill, including it adds completeness. I'll make sure the HTML container resembles a letter, setting the margin to about 720px and using a typewriter font like 'Courier New.' The line height and off-white background should create a nice look without being overly complicated. I’ll ensure the "enclosure" is underlined and style the typed signature correctly with the exact spacing.
**Clarifying the name formatting**

I'm looking closely at the name formatting in the image. The signature shows "(Prof. Dr. B. L. van der Waerden)" with spaces after the periods, but the typed version seems to lack those spaces. It's important to double-check: in the image, the correct form looks like "(Prof. Dr. B. L. van der Waerden)," but I need to determine if the typed variant has no spaces between "Prof.", "Dr.", and the initials. Understanding this detail will ensure the accuracy of my output, so I'll focus on the spacing after the periods.
**Finalizing the HTML letter**

I see that the name should be typed as "Prof.Dr.B.L.van der Waerden" without spaces after the periods, reflecting the German style. For the closing line, I’ll space it with a right indent using `text-align: right`. I’ll also italicize the signature "B" to simulate handwriting, but I'll transcribe it accurately to maintain formality. 

I need to ensure line breaks are correctly replicated using `<br>` tags within `<p>` or `<div>`. The final HTML will feature a styled letter with necessary details and elements, ensuring everything is neatly presented and correct!
