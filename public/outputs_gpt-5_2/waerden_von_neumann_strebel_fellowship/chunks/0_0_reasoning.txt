**Designing text style**

I'm thinking about how to underline "Princeton." Options include using border-bottom or a styled span with underline. But I notice that in the image, the underline extends further than the word's width, so I'll try approximating it with the border-bottom. 

I also need to add "Hb 62. 6525" in light gray at the top left. It seems I could lighten that with CSS; a color like #777 and an italic style should work. The ambiguity of how to format the scribble is a bit tricky, especially the colon placements.
**Transcribing document features**

I’ll transcribe "Hb 62. 6525" as it is, making sure to replicate the spaces. Next, I need to include "Professor Dr. J. von Neumann" exactly as it is typed, maintaining the spacing. For the address, "Institute of Advanced Study" and "New Jersey" will be included too, but I’ll only underline "Princeton." The date should be "18th of January 1953," and I want to right-align it while keeping the address left-aligned and slightly offset. I’ll use CSS to handle positioning, ensuring everything fits within a 900 px wide container.
**Creating HTML structure**

I’m thinking it’s important to include the MathJax script in the HTML setup. First, I’ll create an HTML skeleton with UTF-8 charset for proper encoding. I want to add a title like "Transcription" and style it for a letter-like appearance, but I need to be mindful about omitting any partially cut-off lines. I’m considering a gentle background color, like #f7f1e6, which feels pretty, but I’m not entirely sure if it’s necessary for this context. Let’s make sure we get it just right!
**Finalizing letter styling**

I’m structuring the CSS for a nice letter format. The font is set to "Courier New" for that typewriter vibe, and I’m aiming for a max width of 900px with a light parchment background. I’m adding padding and some subtle box shadow for depth. The date will be right-aligned, and I'll ensure the address is pushed to the right while keeping line breaks with `<br>`. I’m also underlining just the word "Princeton," matching the image's style. I should consider adding some vertical white space above the address for better readability!
**Refining letter details**

I’m adjusting the letter's spacing now. For "Princeton," I'll use non-breaking spaces to achieve that spaced-out effect, which should be nice. I also want to ensure that "Professor Dr. J. von Neumann" has two spaces between "J." and "von," as it appears in the image. I’ll do this using "J.&nbsp;&nbsp;von" to maintain the spacing. The address lines should float right, and I want to keep it in a monospace font for that typewriter look. I’ll double-check the spelling of "January" too. Let’s finalize the HTML!
