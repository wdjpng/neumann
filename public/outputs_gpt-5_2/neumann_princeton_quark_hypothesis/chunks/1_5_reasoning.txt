**Transcribing text from an image**

I need to transcribe all the text from the image into HTML while keeping the formatting intact, though I should ignore any partially cut-off lines. The image contains a handwritten German snippet. My goal is to nicely replicate the header and capture the full sentences. I must use MathJax for any math expressions, even if there are none besides quotes or dashes. I wonder which lines are partially cut off, especially since the top line might be truncated.
**Analyzing handwritten text**

The top may have tiny cut-off ascenders but they are still visible. The bottom shows full lines, and there's a margin on the left and an embossed stamp on the right with no text. I’ll transcribe the first line: “Der Beweis beruht auf der Betrachtung.” I thought “beruht” looked like “bemüt,” but it seems correct as “beruht.” The second line continues with “unitärer und unbeschränkt-,” which likely means “unitärer und unbeschränkt-hermitischer Operatoren.” The hyphen indicates a line break, so “unbeschränkt-” is on one line, and “her-” starts the next.
**Examining the transcription details**

The third line shows “mitischer Operatoren,” which seems to start covered. On the second line, I see “unitärer und unbeschränkt-her-,” indicating a hyphen break. The word on the third line begins with “mitischer,” completing “hermitischer.” Additionally, there's a long dash after “Operatoren.” Moving on to the fourth line: it starts with “Die allgemeine Depression, die hier,” but could it be “Die allgemeine Definition”? That makes more sense in a mathematical context, as the handwriting might suggest “Definition” rather than “Depression.”
**Determining the correct word**

I'm analyzing the shape of the letters to figure out whether the word is “Definition” or “Depression.” The image shows “Die allgemeine Depension, die hier.” It has a ‘p’ that extends below, while “Definition” wouldn’t have that. The letters seem to suggest “Expression” too—maybe “Die allgemeine Expression, die hier”? Although “Expression” isn’t typical in German, it could have been used in the past. The initial letter looks like a capital ‘E,’ with the ‘sion’ ending strongly indicating “Expression.”
**Preparing HTML transcription**

I think the text could be “Die allgemeine Expression, die hier,” which makes sense as a math phrase. So I’ll transcribe the lines:  

1. "Der Beweis beruht auf der Betrachtung"  
2. "unitärer und unbeschränkt- her-"  
3. "mitischer Operatoren. —"  
4. "Die allgemeine Expression, die hier"

There are small curved marks above some words that seem to indicate separators. The hyphen breaks between lines are essential to keep. I’ll format it in HTML and style it to resemble handwriting while ensuring readability. I'll wrap it in a `<pre>` tag to maintain line breaks accurately. Let's produce the HTML snippet.
