**Considering MathJax Implementation**

I'm thinking about how to craft this part. They want to use MathJax to render math, so we might want to wrap \(N\) to ensure it’s displayed properly. I’ll include the MathJax library from the CDN in the head section as requested. It’s also worth noting that we can have \(N\) within a `<span>` tag. For the container, I'll set white-space to pre-wrap to facilitate rendering without issues. I'm trying to make sure everything works well!
**Creating HTML with Hyphenation**

I'm focused on ensuring normal hyphenation without unnatural line breaks, so I want to keep the hyphen in the text. I’ll start with the phrase “notwendig und hinreichend, wenn” with a lowercase ‘n’ as shown in the image. The next part is “die obige Gleichung nur für offene Mengen \(N\) (oder etwa nur für Summen end-lich vieler Würfel) verlangt wird.” I’ll also ensure proper encoding for "Würfel" with the umlaut. Finally, I’ll produce the HTML as the user requested!
