**Considering image chunking**

I need to split an image of a handwritten letter in German into rectangular chunks, adhering to some constraints. The big rule here is to keep 8 lines of text per chunk while ensuring that the entire width of the page is included—with some flexibility. Since it's a single page with margins and holes, I must make sure that each line is fully included, even if some lines are slightly slanted. I might aim for 3 or 4 chunks to cover 6-8 lines each.
**Clarifying image resolution**

I need to determine the correct resolution for the final image. The provided metadata shows 966x768, but there's some confusion because it references both width and height in different contexts. The last line indicates “resolution 966 768,” which suggests the height is 966 and the width is 768. I'll need to confirm the actual pixel dimensions of the image, as there have been previous instances where 1536x1204 was provided instead. Ultimately, I want to ensure I have the right orientation for width and height.
**Determining output dimensions and chunks**

I’ve settled on output dimensions of (768, 966). The image is in portrait orientation, meaning it's taller than wide, confirming width as 768 and height as 966. Now, I need to plan the chunks for the letter page, which extends nearly the full width, accounting for margins. Since there’s a slight tilt at the edges, I can set x1 to around 20 and x2 to about 748 to include the full width. There should be no more than 8 lines of text per chunk, and it looks like there might be about 12-15 lines in the bottom half of the page, near y=50.
**Counting lines and planning chunks**

Let’s count the lines starting from around y=55 with "herrscht, ist Ihnen..." as the first line. I can see there are about 16 lines total when including sections like "Mit den besten Grüssen..." and "Ihr ergebener Johann von Neumann." To keep it safe, I’ll create three chunks to avoid exceeding eight lines in any chunk. I’m thinking of splitting it into a top chunk of 7-8 lines, a middle chunk of 6-7 lines, and a bottom chunk of 3-4 lines. I need to make sure each line is fully contained, considering they may be slanted. For y coordinates, I estimate the top margin as y=40 and the main lines reaching up to around y=430, while the horizontal crease lies near y=520.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates and resolution**

I need to establish accurate cropping for the image, taking into account the horizontal crease at around y=518. Given the text extends from about y=45 to roughly y=900, I can outline the chunks. I'll use the full width of 768 to ensure we include the entire image. After careful estimation and adjustments, I've settled on four chunks to avoid cutting any lines and include proper overlaps. 

The final coordinates are:   
(0, 0, 768, 360)   
(0, 330, 768, 640)   
(0, 610, 768, 800)   
(0, 780, 768, 966)   
The resolution is (768, 966).
