**Analyzing image chunking**

I’m thinking about the “whole width of letter page.” This means I should account for the page edges along with margins. Setting the full width, x1=0 and x2=767, seems appropriate, but I must ensure that lines of text aren’t cut off. I’ll use overlapping vertical boundaries for slanted lines. Also, I have to consider y coordinates to avoid cutting through handwritten lines. By choosing boundaries at blank spaces and estimating safe overlaps, I’ll create four chunks with about 4-6 lines each.
**Calibrating chunk boundaries**

I need to ensure that text lines are fully included in each chunk. I'm considering some coordinates for the chunks: for the first chunk, I might use [0, 60] to [767, 310], which could give me about 6-7 lines. Then for the next chunks, it looks like I’ll aim for [0, 280] to [767, 550], [0, 520] to [767, 750], and lastly, [0, 720] to [767, 950]. I’ll overlap by 30 px to avoid splitting lines and plan for five chunks, aiming for a height of around 240 px each. The goal is to capture everything clearly!
**Ensuring chunk integrity**

I really need to make sure that every line of text or mathematical expression is fully contained within its chunk. The 20 px overlap might be too tight, so I'm increasing it to 60 px. I'll set my chunk boundaries like this: 

- Chunk 1: (0, 40, 767, 320) 
- Chunk 2: (0, 300, 767, 580) 
- Chunk 3: (0, 560, 767, 790) 
- Chunk 4: (0, 770, 767, 965) 

I also want to confirm that my last chunk effectively captures the bottom lines, potentially adding a fifth chunk if necessary to distinguish sections. It's all about keeping things organized and clear!
**Addressing edge cases**

I'm considering some edge cases here. There are two hole punches left, but they don’t affect the text lines, so that's fine. The main thing is I need to ensure no more than three to four lines of equations or mathematical expressions are in one chunk. I’ll output coordinate pairs as “x1, y1, x2, y2” on separate lines, eliminating parentheses. After that, I’ll finalize with the resolution format of “(width, height).” I’ll also keep in mind to avoid cutting through slanted lines with my y boundaries.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I need to ensure that if a line crosses the boundaries, it won't get cut off. The 20 px overlap might not be enough, so I'm increasing the boundaries to 40-350, 300-640, 600-840, and 800-965, with overlaps of 50-60 px for safety. This ensures that lines near the boundaries are included. After final checks, my chunks are: 

(0, 40, 767, 350), 
(0, 300, 767, 640), 
(0, 600, 767, 840), 
(0, 800, 767, 965). 

I’ll also add the resolution line: (768, 966) for width and height.
