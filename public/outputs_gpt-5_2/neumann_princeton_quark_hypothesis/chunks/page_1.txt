**Determining image segmentation**

I need to segment the image of a handwritten letter in German into rectangular chunks using coordinates. Since there aren't any equations involved, I want to focus purely on text. It’s important to include the full width of the page in each chunk, accounting for the margins. The letter occupies almost the entire width, starting around x  20 and extending to approximately x  745, ensuring the chunks cover the complete width of the letter page.
**Processing image dimensions**

I notice there’s a background border around the image with page edges at about 16 px on the left and 751 px on the right. Since the instruction is to capture the entire width of the letter, I’ll use the full image width, but I need to be mindful of the background. The letter has around 24 lines of text, so I’ll divide it into 4 chunks of roughly 6-7 lines each, ensuring that all lines are fully contained and slightly slanted if necessary.
**Estimating vertical chunk boundaries**

I'm working on setting the vertical ranges for the chunks based on the y-coordinate since the image height is 945 pixels. The top margin is around y 50, and the text ends around y 880. To ensure each line is fully contained and avoid cutting off any text, I'll define chunk boundaries with some overlap. For safety, I’m using the whole width of the image, going from x1=0 to x2=767. The first chunk might stretch from y 0 to maybe 210, considering the header and initial lines cover up to about y 300.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I’m estimating the y-coordinates for the lines in the letter: “Sehr geehrter...” is around y 120, and subsequent lines fall between y 140 to 260, though this is tricky to pin down exactly. I’m planning to create five chunks. 

For example, Chunk 1 will be from y1=0 to y2=220, capturing the header and the first 6-7 lines. I'll include a 20 px overlap between chunks to ensure full line containment. Each chunk will span the full width, from x1=0 to x2=767. The bottom-right coordinates for output will be x2=767 and y2=944, capturing the intended area.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I'm confirming the division into five chunks while ensuring no chunk contains more than eight lines, with an estimated height of 200 pixels per chunk. 

The coordinates for the chunks are as follows: 

1. (0, 0, 767, 200)
2. (0, 180, 767, 380)
3. (0, 360, 767, 560)
4. (0, 540, 767, 740)
5. (0, 720, 767, 944)

The image resolution is (768, 945), and I’ll ensure the y-coordinates stay within the specified range. I think this should work well!
