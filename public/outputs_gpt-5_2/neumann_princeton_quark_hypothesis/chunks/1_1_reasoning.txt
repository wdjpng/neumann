**Transcribing text fragment**

I have an image of a handwritten German text fragment that I need to transcribe into HTML. I must keep the formatting, including line breaks, and use MathJax for any mathematical expressions. The instruction is to ignore lines that are partially cut off, but I have to determine what counts as partially cut. Many lines start mid-word, so those should be ignored. However, I'll need to consider lines that might have partial words at the beginning but aren't completely cut off.
**Examining text lines**

It starts with "im Sinne..." but the left side looks cut off, so I need to ignore that entire line. Moving to the next lines, I see it reads "Prov φ; als existiert z.B. für jede Strecke Λ ...". Reading this cursive handwriting is challenging. I also spot a mathematical expression: "∫_Δ 2(P,N,st) dv_p / (t - s)" where "t - s → +∞" might be positioned above other lines. I’m trying to clarify the phrase "endlichen Volums" which could actually be "endlichen Volumens." It’s a bit tricky!
**Reading lines carefully**

I’m examining the text line by line. It looks like it reads, “Prov φ; als existiert z.B. für jede Strecke Λ,” and I see the symbol Λ nearby. There's an integral expression that could be "∫_Λ 2(P,N,st) dv_p /(t-s)". I'm wondering if "s_Λ" should actually be "∫_Λ". The integrand could read "2(P,N,st)" or maybe "Z(P,N,st)". I've noticed the phrase "t - s → +∞" written above the lines, but I’m confused since “t → s + ∞” doesn’t seem to fit. It's quite a puzzle!
**Analyzing the next line**

I'm moving on to the next line, which mentions "endlichen Volums lines t-s → +∞ (numerisch)." Then I see "Mit Hilfe der Integrale des Systems ist ein einfacher ..." which seems clear enough. I’m unsure about the next word, which looks like "Ausschneid" or "Ausschne". Considering the instruction to ignore partially cut lines, I should only keep the fully intact lines in the middle region that aren't cut off on either side. I’m questioning if any lines are fully intact, especially since the original page might extend beyond the left edge.
**Transcribing and interpreting lines**

The first word seems to start with "Mit," suggesting the left margin might not be cut for this line, indicating it's a new sentence. I need to transcribe the text and math while ignoring partially cut lines. For the line "Mit Hilfe der Integrale des Systems," I'm confident in keeping it. The next part appears to be "Ausschneiden," but I’m unsure. I’ll focus on fully intact lines, considering options like representing uncertain words with brackets. The integral expression looks like: 

$\dfrac{ \int_{\Lambda} 2(P,N,s t)\, dv_p }{ t - s } $ 

It’s quite complex, but I’ll work to format it properly in HTML with MathJax!
**Transcribing and formatting lines**

I'm working on transcribing the lines from the image. I see that some lines are partially cut off on the right, which means they should be ignored based on instructions. I need to focus on the line "Prov φ; als existiert z.B. für jede Strecke Λ" since it's likely intact. I can format the math expression neatly using HTML and MathJax for clarity while maintaining the original layout as closely as possible. 

The math will be presented as:

\[
\frac{\int_{\Lambda} 2(P,N,st) \, dv_p}{t - s}
\]

I'll make sure to align everything correctly and add necessary notes where applicable!
**Preparing HTML output**

I'm deciding to write "Prov φ;" confidently. If it turns out wrong, that's okay. I’ll ensure to include proper HTML code with a UTF-8 meta charset so everything displays correctly, especially since it has umlauts. I'll also include MathJax to render any mathematical expressions. 

I'll output the HTML code while keeping it in a monospaced font for a clean look. I need to make sure that I'm only including fully visible lines, even if it’s tricky to determine exactly which those are. Let's finalize this!
