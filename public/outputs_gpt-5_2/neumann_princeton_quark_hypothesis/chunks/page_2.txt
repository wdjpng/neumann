**Determining image chunking**

I'm figuring out how to split the image of a handwritten German text into chunks. The instructions call for including the whole width of each letter page in each chunk when it makes sense. I see that the image should cover lines without splitting them unnecessarily due to any curvature. I think it's best to set my coordinates to cover the width of each letter page while handling the margins appropriately. I aim to create 4-6 chunks in total.
**Analyzing chunk limitations**

I need to ensure that no chunk contains more than 3-4 lines of mathematical expressions. The page seems full of short equations embedded in text. However, it seems that they're treated as lines with math formulas. Notably, the top line continues from a previous page and includes a mathematical inequality along with text. I see that while many lines include math, there’s some flexibility to overlap if necessary. I’ll take time to inspect the image closely to set my boundaries properly.
**Defining chunk parameters**

I need to split the handwritten content into smaller chunks of 8 lines or fewer while making sure not to split any single mathematical expression. Since the handwriting includes curved lines, I'll increase the vertical margins to accommodate entire lines. My plan is to create horizontal slices that cover the full width of the page, aiming for about 6 chunks total. I see that the image resolution is 960x768, with width 768 and height 960, but I need to verify this to avoid confusion.
**Clarifying image resolution and bounding boxes**

The annotation saying "resolution 960 768" indicates that the image is in portrait mode, with a width of 768 and a height of 960. I see that typical datasets for portrait pages use this resolution. I should output the resolution as (768, 960). Now, I need to determine the bounding boxes and estimate the page area within the image since it's centered and has some background. While I could include the entire image width for safety, I need to ensure I also respect the instruction to include the whole width of each letter page, even if it might mean including some background.
**Establishing chunk boundaries and margins**

The page has about 30-pixel margins on the left and right, so I’ll include x1=0 and x2=767 to ensure no lines are clipped. Next, I need to separate the vertical content by estimating line positions and creating 6 chunks, each with 5-6 lines. The first chunk will include about 6-7 lines, and I need to keep track of mathematical expressions, ensuring each chunk has no more than 2-3 math lines while overlapping the chunks to avoid splitting lines. I'll set x1=0 and x2=767 while carefully crafting the y values to accurately capture all content.
**Defining chunk coordinates**

I propose using 6 chunks with specific coordinates to cover the content well. Each chunk will be around 170-180 pixels tall, ensuring we don't exceed 8 lines. I'll set up the chunks as follows:

1) (0, 0, 767, 170)
2) (0, 150, 767, 320)
3) (0, 300, 767, 480)
4) (0, 460, 767, 640)
5) (0, 620, 767, 800)
6) (0, 780, 767, 959)

These ranges will help ensure we capture all necessary lines while being mindful not to split any mathematical expressions and allowing for overlaps. I'll finalize everything, ensuring all coordinates are integers.
