**Analyzing image for expression separation**

I need to split the image into chunks based on bounding rectangles to separate lines and equations. The document is handwritten in German with inline math expressions, but importantly, chunks should contain only two to four lines of mathematical expression. Defining what constitutes a "line of mathematical expression" is tricky since many lines mix inline math with explicit equations like Z(P,N,s,t). I plan to visually analyze the page, which has about 14-16 lines of text, and specific dimensions, to provide accurate chunks.
**Defining chunking requirements**

The main task is to create chunks with a maximum of around 8 lines of text each and limit equations to 3-4 lines per chunk. There are about three displayed equations near the top, but some seem to be inline with text, which complicates things. It’s safer to segment: for Chunk 1, I’ll include the top portion, starting near the top margin. I might estimate coordinates starting at roughly y  60, considering some margins for a clearer layout.
**Setting bounds for image chunking**

I need to define the horizontal bounds to include the entire width of each letter page—setting x1 to 20 and x2 to 748 seems reasonable for that, but since the page is centered with margins, setting x1=0 and x2=768 might be safer. The instruction is to include the whole page width, not just the image itself, ensuring I capture all the lines. However, I must avoid including scanning borders. I plan to split the image into four vertical chunks, starting with Chunk A from y 40 to about y 260, which will cover the top lines and the initial displayed equations.
**Counting displayed equations**

I need to count the displayed equations in the top text lines. Line 1 discusses "Zeitintervalle s <= t in N...," followed by Line 2 with "Z(P,N,s,t) ist ..." containing some equations. Line 3 has additional text about "im Sinne der Mittelwert." Then, Line 4 seems to have an integral with Sλ 2(P,N,s,t) dφ, which counts as a displayed equation. Line 5 provides more text, while Line 6 mentions Z(P,N) = lim with another displayed expression. Finally, Line 7 presents "Z(P,N) = mass N / mass φ (d.h.)," which also looks like a displayed equation. So, within these lines, there could be 2-3 displayed equations.
**Creating chunk coordinates**

I need to ensure that no chunk contains more than 3-4 lines of equations, and text lines should stay within 8 lines. For Chunk 1, I plan to include lines 1-8, while Chunk 2 continues with "die Hypothese gilt dann und nur dann, wenn..." and will likely cover 6-7 lines. Chunk 3 will capture the lines about "U.w. ist die Betrachtung aller messbaren Mengen..." and the final Chunk 4 will include "Der Beweis beruht...". I’ll use overlaps to safeguard against cutting lines. For adjustments, I will establish pixel y positions based on the image height and determine that each chunk should roughly be around 180 px tall, ensuring complete lines are captured. After calculating, the coordinates will be 0 to 768 for width and adjusted heights for each chunk, ensuring all lines are included without splitting equations.
