**Creating HTML with MathJax**

I need to provide inline content using TeX-AMS and mimic handwriting with CSS. The structure requires putting content into `<div class="line">`, while making sure to avoid any unnecessary lines. Since the tool requires only the HTML code, I’ll assemble that without the triple backticks.

The MathJax script needs to render mathematical expressions correctly. I’m feeling a bit anxious about possibly misreading "angebbar" versus "angebar.” Accuracy is key here, and I want to finalize this correctly!
