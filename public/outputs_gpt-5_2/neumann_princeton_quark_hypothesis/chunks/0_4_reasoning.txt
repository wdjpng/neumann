**Transcribing German text**

I need to transcribe the visible text from a handwritten German excerpt to HTML while keeping the line breaks. It's important to ignore any lines that are partially cut off. The image shows a middle section, and it looks like the first visible line starts mid-sentence with “dies: Wenn ein mechanisches Sys-.” I need to check if there are any cut-off lines. The top line appears complete, but it's unclear about the bottom line, which ends mid-sentence.
**Preparing HTML transcription**

I have to ignore any partially cut-off text from the screenshot, which helps deal with lines cropped horizontally. The line starting with "dies:" appears intact, while the line above it may have cropped descenders. The bottom line seems complete, but the next line might not be visible. I’ll transcribe all visible lines in HTML, using a monospaced font or handwriting style and adding line breaks with <br>. I might italicize the Greek phi "Φ" as well, confirming it's a capital phi in the context.
**Using MathJax for transcription**

It looks like "Punkt P von Φ" involves italicizing "P," and I'll use MathJax to render mathematical expressions by wrapping Greek letters and variables in TeX. According to the instructions, I can wrap Φ and φ using \( \Phi \) and \( \varphi \). The text shows "φ ist," indicating a lower-case phi for that instance. I need to consider hyphenation for "Sys-" as it continues with "tem" on the next line, which begins with "tem den Phasenraum Φ hat, und." So, the second line starts perfectly there!
**Transcribing German lines**

I’m ready to transcribe the lines as follows:

1: "dies: Wenn ein mechanisches Sys-"
2: "tem den Phasenraum Φ hat, und"
3: "N eine messbare Menge von endlichem"
4: "Volumen in φ ist, und wenn für einen"
5: "Punkt P von φ die Zeit, die es in"

I need to make sure to reproduce the German script exactly, including punctuation and commas. The correct term is "Menge," not "Alenge." The capital N may be stylized. There's an embossed seal on the left, but I’ll ignore that. I’m considering light styling with a parchment background for the text in CSS, crafting a simple HTML fragment with a script for MathJax to enhance the presentation.
**Creating HTML with MathJax**

They want me to provide just the HTML code, not a full document, but I can include a script tag for MathJax. I’ll use a container with a cursive font like 'Georgia' and set a subtle background color. The `<pre>` tag will help preserve line breaks and hyphenation, which is important.

Inside `<pre>`, I'll include the lines and use MathJax for expressions like \( \Phi \), \( \phi \), \(N\), and \(P\). I’ll ensure proper formatting and spacing, keeping the styling minimal yet effective for a vintage feel. I'll finalize that HTML code snippet!
