**Finalizing transcription**

I'm trying to clarify the transcription. It seems like it should be "Highway," not "Highgway." I also need to check how to represent "N.J., U.S.A.," correctly. The first comma might be separated by an exclamation, but I think it's actually just a comma. I’ll keep it that way. Alright, let’s finalize this transcription!
