**Merging HTML fragments**

I need to combine two HTML files into a single one. The first file has a minimal page design featuring "Hz 652 . 6527" in a handwritten style, while the second contains the actual letter's header and body. My goal is to unify them into one file with consistent formatting, keeping the header relatively unchanged. I won't alter the letter's content and will remove any duplicates. It’ll require adjusting fonts and spacing to create a cohesive style while addressing a peculiar "hap$ apply" issue with MathJax.
**Addressing text issues**

I noticed an issue with "hap$ apply," which seems incorrectly typed—probably meant to be "haps apply." The confusion likely comes from a line break that split "per-" and "hap$ apply," but I can't change any letter content according to instructions. The document does say to remove obvious duplicates and ensure unified formatting while preserving the original content. However, it's clear that "hap$" is an error introduced by MathJax. So, I might need to clarify how to approach that without altering the letter.
**Clarifying formatting issues**

The original phrase includes "If not, he could perhaps apply for 1954/55." I see a hyphenation issue with "per-" and "haps apply," and the "$" likely results from LaTeX or MathJax usage. It's unclear why "hap$" was typed—maybe to prevent hyphenation or indicate continuation? The instructions say not to alter letter content but can I correct obvious scanning artifacts? The goal is to unify the formatting while keeping the original content intact. I'm still unsure how to handle this.
**Evaluating text preservation**

I need to keep the textual content intact, but "hap$" likely isn't part of the original letter—it's a result of MathJax use. Leaving it as "hap$ apply" maintains the original wording, but that "$" looks unnatural. The goal is to produce a cleaned letter without altering the actual words, but removing the "$" could be seen as a correction. They requested unified formatting but didn’t mention correcting typos. I'll treat the "$" as a formatting artifact, though I'm inclined to be cautious about content changes.
**Designing consistent HTML layout**

I need to address the content from the original letter while fixing some formatting issues, like "hap$ apply," which isn’t correct and likely a MathJax artifact. I'll convert it to "haps apply" and ensure proper hyphenation by changing "per-" and "haps" into "perhaps." 

The goal is to unify the formatting while keeping the content intact, like maintaining the spaced letters of "S t r e b e l" and "Princeton." I’ll keep dates and the address as found in the second file and eliminate MathJax. Overall, I’ll create a consistent HTML layout where everything reads smoothly with adjusted styling for clarity.
**Creating the final HTML letter**

I want to ensure that the letter maintains its original character spacing, particularly for "S t r e b e l." I'll replace "hap$" with "haps," resulting in "perhaps" for clarity but won't change the meaning. We need to preserve header alignment and styling, while ensuring all sections are formatted properly into paragraphs.

The closing will remain as "Yours most cordially," followed by the signature spaced as "(B.L.van der Waerden)." I’ll include necessary CSS for aesthetic consistency, eliminating MathJax, and making sure everything is displayed as required. Now, let’s put the final HTML together.
