**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe the text from an image to HTML. The handwritten fragment looks like "Hz 652 : 6527" or maybe "Hz 652 . 6527". I should zoom in on the details. It seems the dot could be punctuation, either acting as a period or perhaps part of a decimal. I clarify that "Hz" likely refers to frequency units. They ask for MathJax for rendering, but I just need to transcribe the text accurately while keeping the formatting simple.
**Crafting a stylized HTML document**

I need to produce an HTML document that displays the text in a visually appealing way, focusing on making it pretty! I’ll completely ignore any lines of text that are partially cut off in the screenshot and only include fully visible text. I want to craft minimal HTML, potentially using a monospace font to mimic a handwritten note style. For the text, I'll include "Hz 652 · 6527," carefully replicating the original as closely as possible, with a middle dot for clarity. I'll also make sure to add a container with a large top margin for better presentation.
**Preparing HTML for text display**

I see that I need to clarify the text formatting around "Hz" or "H2". The dot in "652 . 6527" has extra spaces, and there's some uncertainty if it should read as "Hz" or "H2", given the ambiguous shape of the characters. I’ll choose to stick with "Hz 652 . 6527" for accuracy. For the HTML, I’ll create a basic document with a simple style. A textured background isn't necessary, but I'll consider a nice font that resembles a pencil, like Georgia or Caveat. I'll ensure a large margin and craft a div to neatly display the line with specific styles for size, color, and spacing.
**Finalizing HTML code**

I'm setting the line-height to 1 and preserving whitespace with white-space set to pre. Now it's time to produce the final HTML code. They mentioned using MathJax to render mathematical expressions, but since we don't have any math to display, including the MathJax script isn’t necessary. Even though external calls weren't restricted, it's safer to skip it. I’ll make sure that our content is precisely "Hz 652 . 6527," using regular spaces rather than non-breaking ones. Let's finalize this!
