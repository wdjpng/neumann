**Transcribing HTML formatting**

I need to create an HTML representation that closely matches the formatting of the typed letter. It's important to read the content carefully and not overlook any details. I see a date at the top right: "31. Jan. 1953"; there’s a dot after 31. The sender's info states "Prof. Dr. John von Neumann" and outlines the address with spaced letters for "Princeton". I plan to use CSS letter-spacing to replicate that effect precisely, considering non-breaking spaces between the letters for accuracy.
**Formatting the letter in HTML**

I can write "P r i n c e t o n" with spaces to match the original format. For underlining, I might use CSS properties or an `<hr>` element to create a line underneath. I'll wrap the text in a `<span>` with `border-bottom` set to create a thick underline as shown. Below that, I'll include "New Jersey." For the salutation "Dear von Neumann," I'll add a comma. The body consists of block paragraphs with indentation and double spacing, and I need to maintain the exact line breaks and wrapping to match the typed letter's monospaced style.
**Transcribing letter lines**

The letter includes the line "Many thanks for your letter of," which follows a blank line and is indented about five spaces. I'll replicate that indentation using non-breaking spaces for consistency. Then there's "Jan. 23. Dr. S t r e b e l has applied for," and the line should break just after "of" to match the original layout.

Following that, I have "a Swiss stipendium, which will enable him to" and the next line is "go to America." The letter continues with "We have the impression that" and "this will be granted." I'll also include the hyphenation at the line end for "could per-" and subsequent text as it appears for accurate line breaks. Finally, I have "the application forms you sent me."
**Formatting closing lines**

For the closing lines, there's a blank space followed by "Yours most cordially," which appears to be centered with about 16 spaces on the left. I’ll replicate this indentation accurately. After another blank line, the name "(B.L. van der Waerden)" is shown. I need to ensure there’s no space after the dot in "B.L." and keep the spelling of "Waerden" as it appears.

To preserve the formatting, I’ll use a `<pre>` block in HTML, which will help maintain whitespace and line breaks. The date will also be aligned top-right to match the document's layout.
**Constructing the HTML structure**

I need to create an HTML structure that effectively replicates the letter's formatting. I’ll use a container `<div>` with a monospace font and a width of about 600px. The date line will be right-aligned, while the address will be left-aligned. I’ll ensure line breaks within paragraphs are preserved without heavy formatting. 

The "P r i n c e t o n" line should be underlined with CSS text-decoration to create a visually appealing style. For the body text, employing a `<pre>` block will help maintain line breaks and indentation. I need to ensure the hyphenation in lines, like "per-," is accurately represented. 

Finally, I’ll carefully transcribe each line, ensuring to note any specifics about spacing, such as "31.Jan. 1953" with no space after "31." Let's include MathJax in the document, and remember to follow the formatting constraints requested.
**Transcribing the letter body**

I'm going to transcribe the body of the letter, maintaining line breaks and indentation. I'll start with “Dear von Neumann,” at the left margin. After a blank line, I’ll add the line “Many thanks for your letter of,” indented with about eight spaces.

It's important that each subsequent line remains left-aligned. I'll ensure to preserve the hyphenation in "per-" and center the closing line "Yours most cordially." The signature will be formatted as "(B.L.van der Waerden)" without a space after "B.L." I’ll carefully format the HTML to reflect all these details correctly, ensuring everything is just right.
