**Outputting image coordinates**

I need to focus on outputting the chunk coordinates for the scanned image of a letter, which contains typed text—no need for math expressions here. I’ll limit the lines per chunk to about eight and can be flexible with fewer chunks for headers. It’s important to capture the full width of the letter page, so I need to detect the page boundaries in the image. Knowing the width and height from the image metadata is crucial; it looks like it might be 1053 x 768.
**Determining image dimensions**

It seems the typical displayed size of the image is likely 1053 in height and 768 in width since the phrase "resolution 1053 768" appears multiple times. I’ll adopt the coordinates as (768, 1053) and ensure they’re in integer format, starting from the top-left origin. I need to break the image into chunks while capturing the text lines accurately. For instance, the date appears around x 530 to x 710 and y 85. I should consider including the full width of the letter page for each chunk.
**Structuring text chunks**

I’ve got the text partially organized, with lines 5 to 7 giving me about seven lines in the paragraph, plus one for the salutation, making a total of eight lines. This fits nicely into a single chunk, but I do need to consider that the lines might not be perfectly straight. The instructions say they may overlap, which is okay. Then I have the closing line "Yours most cordially" and the signature near y 930. I could combine these into one chunk to satisfy the eight-line limit. I’ll start with the top area, including the date and address lines. Adding an underlined "Princeton" seems fitting too!
**Defining chunk dimensions**

I’m determining the dimensions for the address block lines, which are around y 150-260, with the date at y roughly 80. I need a rectangular chunk that covers the left area, as the instructions suggest including the full width of the letter page when reasonable. Since the letter page width is narrower than the full image, I’ll opt for a range that covers from approximately x=30 to x=740, given that the leftmost edge is about x 45 and the right edge around x 740.
**Establishing chunk boundaries**

To be safe, I plan to include the entire image width of 0-768, even though I should focus on the letter page width as instructed. The top margin appears around y 35-40, but there's a pencil scribble at y 12 that needs to be counted as text, so I'll include it in the header. I'll set the first chunk to include this scribble and the date, ranging from x 35 to 740 for width and y 0 to about y 285.  

The second chunk will cover "Dear von Neumann" and seven paragraph lines, from y 300 to y 700. Finally, the third chunk will capture the closing and signature from y 700 to about y 1045. I’ll maintain margins for full containment, ensuring no lines are split and allocating some space for overlap where necessary.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I’m wrapping up the chunk coordinate setup. I’ve ensured slight overlap between chunks: for chunk 1, I've set y2 to 285, and for chunk 2, y1 to 280. I’ve decided to use the entire image width from 0-767 to ensure that all text lines are included. I’ve finalized the coordinates as follows: 

Chunk 1: (0, 0, 767, 285)  
Chunk 2: (0, 280, 767, 705)  
Chunk 3: (0, 700, 767, 1052)  
Resolution: (768, 1053)
