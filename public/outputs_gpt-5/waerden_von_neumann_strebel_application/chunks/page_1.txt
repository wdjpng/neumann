**Evaluating bounding boxes for letter chunks**

I need to create bounding boxes for sections of a scanned letter, focusing on 2-10 rectangular chunks. Since it’s plain text, I should group it into a few main sections: the header and address, date, salutation, body paragraphs, closing, and signature. The instructions suggest including the full width of the letter page, so I’ll consider using coordinates starting near zero, but I must keep the margins in mind since the page has a border.
**Analyzing letter chunking instructions**

I need to include the whole width of the scanned letter page in each chunk to prevent cropping. The letter is in portrait orientation with a resolution of 1053x768. I see the date at the top right, "31. Jan. 1953," and the addressee's information on the left, which is underlined. The instructions specify no more than eight lines of text per chunk, so I’ll likely make around 4-5 chunks, starting with the date and the addressee block.
**Chunking the letter content**

I've identified that the addressee, "John von Neumann," spans four lines, making it a good candidate for one chunk. The greeting line "Dear von Neumann," could either stand alone or be combined with the first paragraph. However, I must keep to the eight-line maximum per chunk, so combining is feasible. The body is longer, with about 8-10 lines that might need to be split into 1 or 2 additional chunks. I'll analyze each line closely to ensure they fit appropriately.
**Finalizing chunks for the letter**

The paragraph I’m analyzing has about seven lines, including, “I keep the application forms you sent me.” The closing lines, “Yours most cordially,” and “(B.L. van der Waerden)” make up two lines, which I could treat as one chunk. There's also a small pencil note in the corner, but it's not essential for the letter. I need to include the entire page width in each chunk, which means I'll use the full width of the image rather than cropping to the text only.
**Determining bounding box coordinates**

I need to set the chunk coordinates for scanning, focusing on ensuring that I include the entire width of the letter page without cropping. The image is 768 pixels wide and 1053 pixels tall. I’ll start by defining x1 as 0 and x2 as 767 (to stay within bounds). Each chunk must contain every line of text fully, including any scribbles. I’m estimating y coordinates for the various elements, planning to split them into chunks based on appropriate boundaries to avoid cutting any lines. I'll create five chunks to cover all necessary sections.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I've determined the coordinate boundaries for each chunk of the letter. Chunk 1 captures the header scribble and date from y=0 to y=180. Then, chunk 2, covering the addressee block, will go from y=180 to y=360. For chunk 3, the salutation line runs from y=360 to y=450. Chunk 4, which holds the body text, will be from y=450 to y=800. Lastly, chunk 5 encompasses the closing and signature from y=800 to y=1052. I’ll finalize the resolution as (768, 1053).
**Refining chunk boundaries**

Let's reevaluate the chunk coordinates. I'll set chunk 1 from y=0 to y=170, capturing the header scribble and date. Chunk 2 will span y=171 to y=328 for the address block. For chunk 3, which includes the salutation line, I'll set it from y=329 to y=420. Chunk 4 will cover the body text from y=421 to y=780. Finally, chunk 5 will capture the closing and signature lines from y=781 to y=1052. I'll finalize the resolution as (768, 1053).
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I need to finalize the coordinate output without heavy formatting, providing one pair per line. It's crucial to include the top scribble. So, I have the coordinate pairs ready:

(0, 0, 767, 180)  
(0, 181, 767, 360)  
(0, 361, 767, 450)  
(0, 451, 767, 800)  
(0, 801, 767, 1052)  
(768, 1053)  

I’ve adjusted chunk boundaries to ensure no lines are split between chunks. Let’s deliver the final output! I feel good about these choices.
