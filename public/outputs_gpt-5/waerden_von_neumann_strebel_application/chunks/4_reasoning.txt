**Considering text alignment**

I’m thinking we should align the text to the right of center, but replicating the exact margins might be tricky. I’ll create a container that approximates the card width and aligns the text near the center. The original formatting seems close to centered, but not exactly. I’ll use a monospaced typewriter font like Courier and keep the line breaks as they are. It looks like we need to position the text almost vertically centered, going from there!
**Planning text alignment and formatting**

I’m aiming to place the text near the center but slightly to the right. I think using CSS with `text-align: center;` is a good start, even if the typed text seems a bit right-of-center. I might try a container with 60% width and auto margins, but actually, centering the text seems fine. 

For spacing, I’ll ensure I keep the parentheses and punctuation correct for "B. L. van der Waerden." Let’s put together the HTML and CSS to get the layout just right!
**Finalizing HTML layout**

I’m wrapping up the HTML for the text, remembering that I need to keep formatting as close to the original as possible. I’ll center the single line horizontally but lean it a bit to the right while maintaining the monospaced type style. 

I should also consider building in some vertical space to replicate the original image layout, maybe setting the width to 1400 to match the aspect ratio. I just need to ensure I don’t add unescaped parentheses and keep things clean. Let’s finalize the markup without any disclaimers!
**Adjusting text position**

I’m considering how to position the text slightly to the right-of-center using `transform: translateX(20%);`, but that feels a bit unnatural. To play it safe, I think I’ll keep it centered instead. 

As I finalize the HTML, I want to make sure the font isn’t too heavy, and while the original looked like 16px, I might set it to 20px for clarity. I’ll also add some letter styles. It’s time to wrap things up!
