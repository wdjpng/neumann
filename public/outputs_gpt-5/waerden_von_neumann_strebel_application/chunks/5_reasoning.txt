**Transcribing image text to HTML**

I need to transcribe the text from the image into HTML while maintaining the formatting. The text "(B. L. van der Waerden)" is likely near the top and possibly right-aligned. The formatting should ensure the text remains as close to the original as possible. It makes sense to output this text with the appropriate HTML elements, like wrapping it in a `<pre>` tag to preserve the monospaced formatting. I'll keep the spacing correct after the initials, too.
**Formatting HTML code**

The instruction is clear: we need to keep the formatting as close to the original as possible. It seems I'll replicate the line with parentheses and utilize a `<pre>` to preserve spacing. Since centering might be unnecessary, but CSS could justify the text, the original may not need such formatting. I think the best approach would be to output a minimal HTML snippet using the `<pre>` tag. I’ll ensure to follow the format for the output with triple backticks. Let’s finalize the code!
**Finalizing HTML output**

I’m thinking about how to present the text in HTML while keeping it close to the original. The output you're looking for is the text "(B. L. van der Waerden)" inside the `<pre>` tag, with consideration for spaces or newlines. However, some might require there to be no extra preceding newline, so I can switch to a `<p>` tag.

But I’m also considering alignment—maybe right-aligning it could give a more accurate appearance based on the image. The text seems to favor a right margin. Let's finalize this!
**Deciding on text alignment**

I realize the text may be closer to the center top, with significant whitespace on the right. It seems like the original position is probably centered, and while I can't replicate that perfectly, aligning it to the center might be my best bet. Typically, names in typed letters are either centered or aligned right, often placed above a signature line. Since the formatting isn't very strict, I'll just present the text without heavy adjustments, using: 

```html
<pre>(B. L. van der Waerden)</pre>
```

But adding non-breaking spaces isn't necessary, as a minimal approach feels more suitable.
