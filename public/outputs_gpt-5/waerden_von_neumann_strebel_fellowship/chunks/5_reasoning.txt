**Finalizing HTML output**

I'm considering how to set the `<pre></pre>` tags without spaces. I wonder if there might be faint hyphens or marks. It seems I should check for details that might affect the final code. I need to provide a code block with an HTML skeleton and an empty `<pre>`. However, they want the output formatted with triple backticks, so I need to keep that in mind as I finalize this.
