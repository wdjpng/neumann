**Transcribing text from image**

I need to transcribe all the text from the image into HTML while keeping the formatting true to the original. The image contains handwritten notes with mathematical expressions, including integrals and Greek letters. I have to ensure everything is accurately captured. It looks like there are parts of the text showing mathematical symbols and variables, such as alpha and beta, possibly within a wider context. I'll visualize this to help guide the transcription process.
**Reading lines from the image**

I'm trying to read each line from the image to accurately transcribe it. At the top, I see something like "(∑ a(α,β) S*(α,β) dα dβ)", but I'm not entirely sure. The image is small, so I might need to visualize or enlarge it. There’s a part that includes "S*(m, v) = ∫∫ e^{i(?) (vα - mβ)} a(α - m, β - v) S(α,β) dα dβ." This appears to involve two-dimensional Fourier transforms or correlations. I need to examine the variables closely for accuracy.
**Transcribing more lines from the image**

I see that the next line contains "∫∫ e^{- i (v α - m β)} a(α - m, β - v) S(α, β) dα dβ." There's a difference sign, but I'm not entirely certain. Following that, it includes "∫∫ a(α, β) S*(α, β) dα dβ." I need to parse this carefully. The top slice might show parts of prior lines, and I wonder if we could make an HTML that includes best approximations of the formulas while using placeholders like “[?]” for anything ambiguous. Accuracy is key, after all!
**Transcribing and analyzing the text**

The instructions clearly state to fully transcribe all text, but I’m realizing we might need to do our best to replicate the characters accurately. I’ll focus on analyzing the shapes of the symbols. Pasting from the second line, it shows "S'(m, v) = ∫∫ e^(i(v α - m β)) a(α - m, β - v) S(α, β) dα dβ," which looks like a plausible structure for 2D convolution. The third line has similar negative exponents, possibly indicating conjugates with S*. I'll examine it closely.
**Transcribing complex lines**

I’m analyzing the second row, which might include different lines with plus/minus exponent signs. The next line starts with "∫∫ a(α, β) S*(α, β) dα dβ," and that seems like part of a larger equation. The third line adds to that, but determining the details is tough. I think I can create HTML that reflects the handwritten content closely, using placeholders like “[?]” for unclear parts. I’ll make sure the math looks nice, using monospace for better clarity and style. Let's transcribe exactly what’s visible while keeping it accurate!
**Transcribing mathematical lines**

I’m examining the equations to transcribe them accurately. The last line might be "∫∫ a(α,β) S*(α,β) dα dβ = ∫∫ C(α,β) S(α,β) dα dβ," but I need to approach it carefully. To convey uncertainty, I’ll replace ambiguous parts with ellipses ("..."). I’m considering using a `<pre>` block for the layout and CSS to keep the math neat and readable. The goal is to replicate the text formatting as closely as possible while ensuring all elements are clear and organized!
**Transcribing with confidence**

I think it’s best to focus on transcribing the parts I can read clearly, especially the structure of the integrals and the repeated "S(m,v)" lines. The user asked for a complete transcription, and I want to ensure clarity while respecting the instruction to produce only HTML. I’ll use ellipses ("...") where necessary to indicate missing parts. I’ll craft the HTML, maintaining spacing and formatting with a `<pre>` block for readability, and include the double integral symbol using Unicode. Let’s get started on the code!
