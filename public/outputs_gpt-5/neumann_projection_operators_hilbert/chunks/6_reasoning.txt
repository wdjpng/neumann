**Transcribing handwritten German text**

I need to transcribe all text in the image to HTML. The document consists of a chunk from a handwritten German letter, with some equations included. It's essential to maintain formatting as close as possible, like line breaks, and make it visually appealing, even though there's no header.

I'll consider using <pre> to preserve formatting and spaces for the handwritten style. The text features blue-ish cursive handwriting and mentions math variables like alpha and beta. Let's tackle this step by step!
**Deciphering German text**

I need to transcribe the text as accurately as possible. I notice the left portion features a white hole from a paper punch, and the text probably starts with “mit.” I attempt to read it as:

“mit also (über die ganze α, β - Ebene) absolut integrierbarem.”

I’m unsure about “integrirbaren,” which might also be “integrierbarem.” The phrase looks like it underscores the concept of absolute integrability related to the whole α, β plane. I’ll keep focusing to decipher the text correctly!
**Analyzing equations in text**

I also need to include the math equations I see near the bottom. There's a line that reads, "Es ist leicht, die Rechenregeln für diese Kerne anzugeben, insbesondere ist," followed by something like "* ∫ g(α,β) S(α,β) dαdβ." There might be underlined elements like "a(-α, -β)."

I'll check it systematically, scanning from left to right. At the top left, I recognize "mit" and possibly "also." It looks like I'm getting phrases related to "über die ganze α, β-Ebene" and maybe something about "integrirbaren Kern." The second line has "Kern" in quotes, indicating it's important!
**Reading the text carefully**

It seems they previously defined something as "Kern," perhaps in the context of "Heißt ... integrirbarer 'Kern' a(α, β)." I’m trying to read it better now.

In the first line, I see “mit also (über die ganze α, β - Ebene) absolut integrirbarem.” The word "Kern" appears a second time and might fit in. The abbreviation "abs." for "absolut" has a strikethrough, leading me to think the text might read “mit abs. (über die ganze α, β-Ebene) absolut integrirbarem.” 

I just need to look more carefully at the shapes and letters!
**Clarifying the transcription process**

I'm looking closely at the text to accurately transcribe it. There's a snippet indicating "abs." that might relate to "absolut." I'll read it as: "mit abs. (über die ganze α, β–Ebene) absolut integrierbaren." 

The next line starts with '"Kern" a(α, β). After that, I see phrases like "Es ist leicht, die Rechenregeln für diese Kerne" and "anzugeben, insbesondere ist." 

I also notice a formula involving integrations and a potential expression for complex conjugation. I'll keep refining the lines to ensure each detail is captured accurately while using HTML to maintain formatting!
**Examining the formula for transcription**

I'm closely reviewing the formula again. After the asterisk, it begins with "(", followed by "a(α,β) S'(α,β) = ∫∫..." I want to ensure I capture everything correctly, even if I have to use placeholders for any unreadable parts.

I plan to format this in HTML, ensuring that I preserve line breaks with `<pre>` and stylistic elements for Greek letters. The final structure will involve a few CSS touches for a neat presentation, but I'll prioritize clarity in the transcription while adhering to the user's instructions. My goal is to provide an accurate overall representation!
**Transcribing and formatting text accurately**

I'm focusing on transcribing the text and ensuring it follows the original structure closely. The first line includes “mit abs. (über die ganze α, β‑Ebene) absolut integrierbarem”, with careful attention to punctuation and spacing.

The second line starts with '"Kern" a(α,β). Es ist leicht...' and I'll maintain proper line breaks. I plan to wrap everything in a `<pre>` tag for preservation. Additionally, I’ll apply some minimal CSS styling to beautify the output, including preserving Greek letters and ensuring accurate formatting. I want this to look nice while staying true to the requirements!
