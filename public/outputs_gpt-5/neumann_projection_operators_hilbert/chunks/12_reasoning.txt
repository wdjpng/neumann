**Interpreting mathematical notation**

I'm thinking about how to present this section as HTML while preserving line breaks and any special characters, like α, β, γ, and δ, using <pre> tags. I want to transcribe it accurately without making errors in the math. The equation appears to involve lowercase Latin letters disguised as Greek, and there are specific spacing and symbols to observe. I suspect there's a pattern using a self-adjoint operator or possibly a Fourier transform involved in this notation. I need to inspect it more closely.
**Transcribing mathematical equations**

I'm working on replicating the structure similar to Titchmarsh or Muntz without specifics. I want to transcribe exactly what I can read. Looking closely, I see on the second line after a fraction: "(S(α,β) A f, S(γ,δ) A f) = 4π^2 (A S..." I need to focus more! Since the task is to transcribe the text from the image to HTML, I want to keep formatting as close to the original as possible. Minor errors might be okay, but I shouldn’t add anything unobserved. I'll inspect carefully.
**Analyzing mathematical expressions**

I’m looking at the second part of the line further to the right: " = 4π^2 (A S(α,β) Af, f )". I think I'm also seeing "S(-α, β)??". Then there’s a possible third line that includes "-1/2 (α - r)^2 - 3/2 (β-δ)^2," but that feels improbable. I guess we could use indefinite placeholders for transcription, but the instruction specifies to fully transcribe all text in the image, so I need to be careful. It looks like I should focus more closely to avoid misreading.
**Transcribing handwritten math**

Next, I'm noticing "4π^2" again, which might not be part of a fraction. It looks like it follows the step: " = 1/(4π^2) (S(α,β)Af, S(γ,δ)Af) ; = 4π^2 (A S(α, β) Af, f)". It doesn't seem symmetrical, and usually, the format would start with something like "(f_{αβ}, f_{γδ}) = ...". I’m questioning how to accurately transcribe this since the instructions require preserving formatting. I plan to use a styled <pre> tag to replicate the handwritten math style while ensuring it looks presentable without relying on external fonts.
**Transcribing visible equations**

I’m thinking about how to include inline CSS using generic fonts, but I need to be careful. The instruction only asks for the HTML code, which can include fonts, but I’ll set it to generic cursive in case the viewer doesn’t have the specific font. I want to style the page with a cream background and add spacing without including any inaccuracies. I'm planning to replicate visible equations from the image while keeping the formatting intact, including placeholder text for unclear parts. I'll compile everything while avoiding extraneous scribbles.
**Finalizing HTML transcription**

I’m considering how to approach the transcription while ensuring it’s visually appealing, as the instruction says to "make it pretty." I’ll style the document with a cream background and use `<pre>` to maintain formatting. I plan to include proper Greek letters, subscript for variables, and fractions using a bit of CSS. I need to be cautious about inaccuracies, so I’ll clearly present the equations while ensuring that only visible text is included. Time to finalize the HTML!
