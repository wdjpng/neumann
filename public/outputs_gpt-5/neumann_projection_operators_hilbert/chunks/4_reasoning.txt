**Transcribing to HTML**

I need to fully transcribe text in the image to HTML while keeping formatting close to the original. I want to use Georgia, a serif font, for a calligraphic style. To maintain line breaks and positions, I’ll use a `<pre>` tag. However, since I can't rely on MathJax, I’ll represent math in italics with superscripts and Greek letters using HTML entities for α and β. I'll format expressions with `<sup>` and `<i>` while ensuring it's neat and stylish. Let’s craft that!
**Transcribing German Text**

I'm working on transcribing some lines from an image. The first part retains 'folgenden' in lowercase, matching the original. For the second line, it reads: "Ich führe die unitäre Schar." I might also be seeing "unmitäre," but I’ll stick with "unitäre." There may be additional quotes around "Ich führe die unitäre Schar." The third line includes a mathematical expression: "S(α,β) = e^(1/2 i α β) U(α) V(β)." I'll format this as "e^{½ i αβ}" while considering that superscript formatting can't easily accommodate the ½ sign. Let’s finalize this!
**Creating HTML Structure**

First, I’m planning to format some mathematical text using `<sup>½ i αβ</sup>` while paying attention to spacing. The next line reads "ein, für die Multiplikations-Relationen," and I’ll include a hyphen. 

As for the HTML, I’ll use a `<div class="letter">` and a `<pre>` tag to maintain line breaks. Since there's a request to "make it pretty," I’ll style it to resemble parchment with an italic font, using "Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif" for compatibility. 

Okay, let’s put that HTML structure together!
**Transcribing Text Properly**

I'm handling the transcription of a line that starts with "Ich führe die unitäre Schar" and includes a mathematical expression. I noticed there’s a "..." at the start, but it seems like there should be text cropping from the left—likely starting with "und ich." 

I’ll keep it clean and just start with "und ich glaube mir sie im folgenden zu skizzieren" without adding ellipsis. It's essential to capture everything visible. I’ll also ensure appropriate line breaks using `<br>` or within `<pre>` tags after each line. Let's finalize that!
**Finalizing HTML Code**

I’m using a `<pre>` tag so that line breaks remain as typed. The first line will be "und ich glaube mir sie im folgenden zu skizzieren." I’ll add a blank line after that for spacing. Then, I’ll include "Ich führe die unitäre Schar" as it appears, and next is the formula. 

It's important to closely replicate spacing and avoid adding a multiplication dot; I'll keep spaces as per the original. For the exponent, I’ll opt for "i/2 αβ" using `<sup>` to properly format it. 

I’ll ensure that the text appears neatly while maintaining proper formatting. Let's finalize the HTML code!
