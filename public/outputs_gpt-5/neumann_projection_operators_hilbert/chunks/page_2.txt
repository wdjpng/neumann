**Confirming resolution and chunking**

I’m measuring typical scanning of letter pages, noting the width as around 768 px and the height as 1064 px. Given that the alt says "resolution 967 768," it seems like I should use those dimensions: width 768 and height 967. I need to be precise! Previous datasets show "resolution 1024 768" in portrait mode, and my earlier alt with "resolution 965 768" also confirms width 768 and height 965. So I’ll stick with (768, 967). Now, on to chunking; I should propose 6-9 chunks, starting with the top header and relevant math lines.
**Inspecting image content and chunking math lines**

I'm inspecting the image details and notice some faint text at the top, possibly "Kristens." Below that, from around 35 px to 160 px, are the first math lines with expressions like "dann erkennt man durch leichte Rechnungen" followed by multiple equations such as "A≠0, A=A*, A^S," and so on. I need to ensure that each chunk contains only 2-4 lines of math expressions. This might call for around 8 small-height chunks. To include the full width of each letter page, I think it's best to set x1 to 0 and x2 to 767.
**Defining chunk boundaries for text**

To ensure the full width is included, I see that the edges have no text in the margins, which is fine. It’s important that every line of text or mathematical expression stays within its own chunk without spilling over the boundaries. So, I need to set chunk boundaries between the lines. To do this, I’ll determine the y-coordinates for each line. I can start by approximating heights based on their distribution. There seems to be a top margin at around y  44, and a faint watermark at y  52, which isn't part of the text. The line "Dann erkennt man durch leichte Rechnungen:" seems to start around y  90.
**Chunking equations for precision**

Below the first identified line, there are many equations starting around y 126 and going to 280. I need to be precise with my bounding boxes using numbers, as exact coordinates may be hard to detect. The system validators don't require pixel-perfect accuracy, but I must ensure each line is fully contained. I’ll use generous vertical margins to capture all lines effectively. I’m proposing 8 chunks, starting with Chunk 1: It will include the header "dann erkennt man ..." and about 2-3 lines of equations, specifically from y  60 to 130 for the first line of text.
**Refining chunk boundaries for equations and text**

I notice the first line starts around y 90, so I’m planning to use a top bounding range from 40 to 140, capturing "dann erkennt man ..." and possibly the first equation line. I need to estimate boundaries step-by-step. Examining the text again, I see "A ≠ 0, A = A*, AS^(u,v,1)..." starting from about y 135. I’ll create bounding boxes accordingly:

- Chunk 1: y1=40 to y2=130 for "dann erkennt man ...",
- Chunk 2: y from 135 to 205 for the first 3 equation lines,
- Chunk 3 for further lines from 205 to 280 including additional equations,
- Chunk 4 will include more complex equations with roman numerals I and II.

I’ll continue adjusting as needed for the later text sections while keeping each chunk to a manageable number of lines. Adjusting boundaries ensures full containment of each line.
**Setting precise chunk boundaries for math lines**

I want to ensure that each chunk captures the necessary mathematical expressions without exceeding line limits. For chunk 4, I see roman numerals I and II; they probably shouldn't contain equations, but additional formulas may qualify. We need to limit this to 3 lines of math. Each chunk also needs supportive coordinates.

For example, I've designated:
- Chunk 1: y1=50, y2=140 for the initial lines.
- Chunk 2: y from 140 to 215 for three equation lines,
- Chunk 3: y from 215 to 295 for another three lines.

I aim to avoid cutting through lines by including slight overlaps (5-10 px) between chunks as needed, while still meeting the requirement that every line must be fully contained in one chunk. This means I'll set my final ranges to ensure everything fits snugly!
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I'm organizing the bounding boxes for my math lines into eight chunks. I've set up coordinates, with each box ensuring it includes two to four lines of mathematical expressions without cutting any lines. For example, I'm ensuring slight overlaps to avoid missing anything, while keeping the limits in mind.

I've adjusted the chunks so that:
- Chunk 1: (0, 45, 767, 150)
- Chunk 2: (0, 150, 767, 205)
- Chunk 3: (0, 205, 767, 265)
- Chunk 4: (0, 265, 767, 340)
- Chunk 5: (0, 340, 767, 405)
- Chunk 6: (0, 405, 767, 520)
- Chunk 7: (0, 520, 767, 650)
- Chunk 8: (0, 650, 767, 966)

Lastly, I’ll confirm the overall height and produce the final output format that includes integer coordinates without cropping!
**Finalizing output coordinates**

I’m set to produce the final output for the chunks, laying them out as follows:

(0, 45, 767, 150)  
(0, 150, 767, 235)  
(0, 235, 767, 315)  
(0, 315, 767, 405)  
(0, 405, 767, 520)  
(0, 520, 767, 650)  
(0, 650, 767, 815)  
(0, 815, 767, 966)  
(768, 967)  

I’m double-checking the width and height based on the earlier conclusion. It seems the resolution is indeed width 768 and height 967. Now I’ll finalize the answer format!
