**Finalizing HTML Code**

I'm looking at the formula in the letter and considering how to represent it accurately. I think using "A: = ∫∫ e..." is a safe bet, even though typically "A := " is used. I'll go with "A: =" for my transcription. About the HTML, I need to include line breaks and format correctly, using `<br>` lines. It seems like I'll replicate the phrase "Now setze ich" to keep it natural. I'm making sure everything is finalized properly while focusing only on the HTML code.
**Delivering Final HTML**

I need to ensure that the HTML is finalized correctly. There was some mention of embedding 'alpha' and 'Beta', but I should keep things light and straightforward. I'm noticing some elements feel a bit unnatural, so I'll refine them. Additionally, I need to check the footnote star '*)', making sure it appears correctly with parentheses. With all these adjustments accounted for, I feel ready to deliver the final version now!
