**Formatting HTML for transcription**

I need to produce HTML that accurately transcribes text from an image while maintaining the original formatting, including line breaks. The line "(B. L. van der Waerden)" should be centered horizontally near the upper half of the page. I'll consider using a typewriter-style monospace font with grey text. I can create a container to represent the page size and an off-white background. I’ll ensure the HTML outputs only the necessary code, as requested.
**Crafting HTML snippet**

I need to create a full HTML snippet, including <html> and <head> tags as required. They want it to look nice, replicating a header style. However, since it’s just one line, I can focus on that. 

I’ll set the background color to gray for the body and create a container around 800px wide. It should be centered and placed about 35-40% from the top of the page. The text, which is "(B. L. van der Waerden)", will use a monospace font to reflect the typewriter style, ensuring proper punctuation and spaces.
**Verifying text formatting**

I’m checking the exact format of the name, which should read "B. L. van der Waerden." I want to confirm the spacing between "B." and "L." – and it looks like there's definitely a space in the image. 

The final formatted text should reflect this with the correct spacing, maintaining that slight separation. I’ll create a container for the text, using a smaller font size around 20px to ensure it mirrors the original style accurately.
**Producing minimal HTML**

I need to ensure that the HTML replicates the text exactly as requested. First, I'll include `<meta charset="utf-8">` for proper encoding. 

I’ll style the body with a 60px margin for the letter page while lightening the text color. The line with parentheses will be centered using `text-align: center`, and I can set the top margin to around '40vh' or '35vh'. 

To keep the layout consistent across different display heights, I’ll create a "page" container that’s 1100px wide but with a max width of 800px and an off-white background color.
