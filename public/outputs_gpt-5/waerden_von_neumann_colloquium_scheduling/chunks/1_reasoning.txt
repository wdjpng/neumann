**Formatting a message**

I’m thinking about how to format this message correctly. I need to add 'text-shadow: 0 1px 0 #fff' but that's not crucial. I also want to include the 'pre' tag with 'margin: 0;', making sure the whitespace is preserved.

Next, I’ll craft a multi-line string that starts with "Dear von Neumann," followed by a blank line. The rest of the message will share details about meeting in August. I'll make sure to include around 20 spaces for that final line.
**Formatting alignment concerns**

I need to ensure there's at least a 20-space indent for "Yours most cordially." However, I'm noticing that may not be enough since it could end up too far right. Since the container width is 740 px, I might want to use CSS to right-align instead of relying solely on spaces. While I should replicate the original feel, I can't measure alignment perfectly across fonts. Perhaps creating a "signature" paragraph with "text-align: right" could help me get it as close as possible.
**Crafting the HTML layout**

I’m thinking about how to format the indenting. Maybe I can right-align, but I still want to maintain typed indents using spaces. The 'pre' tag should use 'white-space: pre' to preserve line breaks exactly as typed. For the width, I’m considering a container width of 780 px to avoid line overflow, but I also need to manage narrower containers with 'max-width' and 'overflow: auto'. I’ll make sure to properly capitalize "Neumann" too. Let’s get started on the HTML code!
**Creating the HTML and CSS**

First, I want to confirm that I have the hyphens and colon in the text. Now, it’s time to create the HTML and CSS for the letter. I’ll design a 'paper' style with CSS, giving the body a light background and formatting the letter element for proper margins and padding.

I’ll ensure the 'pre' tag preserves whitespace with 'white-space: pre.' To enhance the typewritten style, I might consider adjusting letter spacing, though it’s not crucial. It’s essential to maintain direct spaces in the 'pre' element as it will keep them intact. Now let's fill in the text!
**Finalizing the letter in HTML**

I’m ready to craft the text for the letter now. It starts with "Dear von Neumann," followed by body text about the vacation period. I’ll ensure I correctly spell "Neumann" and capitalize "Amsterdam." 

The line should ensure there's no trailing space after "However, I shall be delighted to see you." I’ll use HTML to wrap the letter and replicate the exact formatting using 'pre' for whitespace. 

Finally, I'll verify all the spacing and line breaks, especially around "July 18" and "20th until the beginning of the Amsterdam congress," then produce the final HTML.
