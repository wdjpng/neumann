**Formatting HTML representation**

I need to represent the text using HTML and the `<pre>` tag to preserve line breaks and spaces. I’ll wrap the entire text in `<pre>`. For the "Yours most cordially" lines, I notice they require some left indentation. It seems they start farther from the left margin, possibly around column 9. I’ll need to match that indentation closely to maintain the original format without overcomplicating it. Let's keep everything as original as possible!
**Determining indentation for closing**

I'm trying to figure out how to indent "Yours most cordially." In the screenshot, it looks about left-of-center, possibly around a 40% indent. While I can’t count the spaces accurately, I can estimate. The instruction is to keep the formatting close to the original. I think adding around 15 spaces should work, but I also want to ensure that the closing lines align horizontally. I'll aim for around 23 spaces for balance while staying faithful to the original look.
**Analyzing indentation and spacing**

It seems that "Yours most cordially" needs to be included since it's part of the original text. I can estimate about 12 spaces for indentation and use `<pre>` to keep those spaces intact. I’ll also note that in the typed letter, there are two spaces after periods, like after "here." and before "The." I want to make sure I replicate that accurately while preserving the clear format. The first line might indeed have those two spaces after the period, which I should maintain.
**Transcribing text accurately**

The scanned text says "here. The vacations," and I think I see two spaces there, even if it’s hard to confirm. I’ll replicate that. I notice there's also two spaces between "18." and "I," which I’ll include as well. It looks like the letter has a glitch with "th e" in "the Amsterdam," possibly due to a typewriter misalignment. I should transcribe exactly what I see, including any quirks like the misprint with the 'e.' I'll keep it as authentic as possible!
**Producing HTML output**

I see the expected text should be "the beginning of the Amsterdam," and I’ll keep it normal without replicating typographical errors. It’s essential to use HTML formatting properly. I’ll wrap the text in a `<pre>` tag to maintain line breaks as in the image. I plan to choose about 12 spaces for indentation before "Yours," and I’ll include one blank line after "congress." Finally, I'll provide the exact code snippet without any additional text, so here we go! 

```html
<pre>
a vacation period here. The vacations begin
about July 18. I am very sorry that a talk
at our Colloquium therefore is out of question. However, I shall be delighted to see you
personally. I shall be in town from August
20th until the beginning of the Amsterdam
congress. Yours most cordially
</pre>
