**Formatting HTML output**

I need to maintain the formatting in my response. I'll create a simple HTML snippet with a monospace font to mimic a typewriter style. The text should be centered, and I’ll add some top margin since the snippet has a line with a large left margin. 

Keeping it minimal, I can use a `<pre>` tag for the text, and I'll include non-breaking spaces for spacing if necessary. However, I only need to output the HTML code without a full header. I'll ensure to follow the user's request closely!
**Creating centered HTML code**

I’m focusing on making sure the line is centered horizontally. The plan is to use a `<div>` with a monospace font and text alignment centered to display the name.

I need to provide just one line of text in the HTML snippet: I'll make sure to write: 

```html
<html>
<body>
<div style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
(B. L. van der Waerden)
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

I'm trying to avoid heavy formatting and ensure I replicate the spacing accurately, keeping in mind the proper presentation of "B. L." with the required spacing.
