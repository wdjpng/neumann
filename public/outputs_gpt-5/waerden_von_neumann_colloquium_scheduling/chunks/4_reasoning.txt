**Considering HTML Output**

I need to think about how to provide HTML output as requested. They want something that appears blank while technically having content. I could include an empty `<pre>` tag or just a simple `<p></p>`, or non-breaking spaces for blankness. Since they expect actual code, I might use an empty `<pre>` with a non-breaking space. But can I make that work without adding commentary? I suppose I should focus on a minimal approach like this:

```html
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
```
**Finalizing HTML Output**

I’m considering how to respond properly with HTML. Since the content is blank, using `<pre></pre>` seems like the right route. Some validators might want something in there, but ultimately, it wouldn’t display anything. I think delivering it as:

```html
<pre></pre>
```

is appropriate. However, it’s important to make sure to have the “html” preceding the backticks. So the final output needs to be formatted correctly:

```html
<pre></pre>
```

Alright, let’s go with that!
