<pre>
a vacation period here.  The vacations begin
about July 18.  I am very sorry that a talk
at our Colloquium therefore is out of question.
However, I shall be delighted to see you
personally.  I shall be in town from August
20th until the beginning of the Amsterdam
congress.

            Yours most cordially
