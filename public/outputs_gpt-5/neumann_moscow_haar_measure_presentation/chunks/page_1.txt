**Dividing the image into chunks**

I need to split the image into 2-10 rectangular chunks that don't have too many lines of math expressions. The pages are handwritten letters in German, and since there are no mathematical expressions, I can include up to around eight lines of text in each chunk. Since it’s a two-page scan, I’ll ensure I cover the full width of each page when reasonable while maintaining this line limit.
**Chunking pages vertically**

I need to split each page into vertical chunks, grouping approximately 6-8 lines per chunk while ensuring I capture the entire width of each letter page without bleeding into the other page. For both the left and right pages, I must include the header "THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY," "PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY," and the date "Dec 5." This gives me about three lines to work with. I’ll also include the page numbering near the margin, so I’ll need to check the image coordinates and resolution of 1082x768 for accuracy.
**Confirming image resolution and coordinates**

I need to check the resolution, which is recorded as 1082 width by 768 height. This confirms it's in landscape orientation. The coordinates range should be x from 0 to 1081 and y from 0 to 767. I’ll identify the left page’s bounding rectangle, likely around the left half, maybe x from 40 to 518, with a center seam at around x=541. Since the scan shows two pages side by side, I’ll need to approximate the exact coordinate boxes while ensuring all lines are fully included without pixel-level viewing.
**Defining chunk dimensions and spacing**

I’m determining the spacing around the pages, which might be around 20 pixels. I should include the entire width of each letter page in the chunks. For the left page, I estimate the width from x  60 to x  510, and for the right page, from x  570 to x  1020, with a seam around x = 540. I have to provide the top-left and bottom-right coordinates of each chunk, ensuring that all lines are fully included without splitting across boundaries. I plan to create about 5 or 6 chunks: 3 from the left page and 3 from the right.
**Estimating line counts and chunk boundaries**

Let’s estimate the count of lines on the left page. We have a top header, a salutation, and around 14 to 16 lines of handwritten text. I plan to split these into three chunks for better organization.

For the coordinates, I’ll set y from 20 for a small margin capturing the top scribble, with the bottom around y=720. I’ll ensure chunks overlap slightly to avoid splitting any lines, setting x boundaries from 48 to 530 for the left page. I’ll monitor the seam to prevent crossing into the right page while including the entire letter width.
**Setting chunk boundaries for the pages**

I’m determining the boundaries for the chunks on the pages. The right page extends to around x  1036, so I’ll set my boundaries from x=552 to x=1036 for the right side, while keeping the left page at x=60 to x=530. 

For the y coordinates, I’ll start the left chunks at y=10 for the header and set approximately 4 chunks. I’ll aim for 3 for the right side, ensuring that each chunk contains no more than 8 lines and allowing slight overlaps to capture every line fully in the chunks.
**Defining chunk boundaries with overlaps**

I'm refining the chunk boundaries for the pages. The first left chunk includes "Lieber Herr ..." and maybe three following lines. I'll make sure to have overlaps to capture any text fully. For the left page, I'm considering the coordinates; x1 = 40 and x2 = 540, while for the right page, I'll set x1 = 542 and x2 = 1025 to avoid overlapping seams.

For the y coordinates, I’m setting the top chunk at y1 = 20 and y2 = 235, and ensuring overlaps of about 30 pixels. This way, even if a line crosses a boundary, it will be included in at least one chunk!
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I'm deciding on the number of chunks, possibly aiming for six to avoid excess. For the left page, I’m setting boundaries like y1 = 20 and varying y2 for overlaps of 20 to ensure complete inclusion of lines. 

On the right page, I'm adjusting similarly. I've set x-coordinates for left (x1 = 20, x2 = 540) and right pages (x1 = 544, x2 = 1060) to encompass all text. Each chunk needs to be precise to avoid cutting any lines, so I’m maintaining adequate overlaps, setting them around 30 pixels. Finally, I’ll check for any leftover text!
**Finalizing coordinates and boundaries**

I'm adjusting the coordinates for the chunks, making sure to include the top of the page with y1 set to 0 for both pages. For the left and right chunks, I've set their coordinates accordingly.  

To ensure every line is fully contained without clipping, I’m increasing overlaps to 40 pixels, making adjustments for the y boundaries as well. I'm also making sure to check that there aren’t more than eight lines in each chunk, while reluctantly sticking with six chunks total. Now I'll finalize the coordinates and output the resolution while including scribbles for completeness!
**Finalizing coordinates and adjusting overlaps**

I'm finalizing my chunks to ensure I accurately include the entire width of each letter page. For my left and right chunks, I’ve updated the coordinates based on overlapping a bit at the seam, which should ensure no lines are cut off.

I’m sticking to six chunks and making sure that each has no more than eight lines while confirming all lines fit within the set boundaries. The final output will consist of the coordinate pairs for each chunk along with the resolution. Everything looks good to finalize!
**Producing final output**

I need to present the final coordinates for the chunks in separate lines. I'm listing them clearly:  

(0, 0, 545, 290)  
(0, 240, 545, 550)  
(0, 520, 545, 760)  
(540, 0, 1081, 290)  
(540, 240, 1081, 550)  
(540, 520, 1081, 760)  
(1082, 768)  

I'm confirming that the right seam text is included, and I’ll wrap up with the resolution line at the end. Everything seems good to finalize!
