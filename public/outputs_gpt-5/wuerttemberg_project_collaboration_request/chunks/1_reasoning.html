**Transcribing handwritten text**

I need to transcribe text from an image of a handwritten letter in German, focusing on exact replication, including line breaks and formatting. The header is missing, and it’s a snippet with gray pencil or faint pen on textured beige paper. There’s a hole-punch on the left side. The content appears to be in Sütterlin or Kurrent, which complicates transcription since I have to interpret the handwriting accurately. I'll read it carefully and ensure to capture everything visible.
**Transcribing German text**

I’m looking closely at the first line, which seems to start with "schicke ich beiliegend. 3 Literatur," but I’m not quite sure. I think I should zoom in and parse the text carefully. I need to examine each line for clarity to provide an accurate transcription. The user wants me to convert the handwriting into HTML with proper line breaks. I'll strive to produce the best guess possible while maintaining the original spacing. Let’s refine what I see in this snippet!
**Deciphering the text**

I see that the next line starts with "Angaben, die ich nicht einwandfrei," which suggests the previous line likely refers to "3 Literaturangaben." It makes sense that it could say, "schicke ich beiliegend 3 Literatur-". I can confirm the second word is definitely "ich," and the first word starts with 'schicke'.

'Beiliegend' might be spelled as "beiligend," and I believe it says "3 Literatur." I also note the punctuation: it might be a comma instead of a period after "beiliegend." I'm closely examining every detail here to ensure an accurate transcription!
**Analyzing the handwriting**

I see a bullet hole near the first line, which complicates things a bit. So, it looks like the first line says, "schicke ich beiliegend. 3 Literatur," with a period after "beiliegend." 

The second line reads "Angaben, die ich nicht einwandfrei," which I can clearly make out. Moving on to the third line, it appears to say, "feststellen konnte, habe ich mit einem," but maybe it could be "mit Ihnen." The context suggests it might be capitalized. I need to keep examining these scribbles for clarity!
**Transcribing and formatting thoughts**

I’m seeing that the third line might say something like "bezeichnet; wenn Sie Herr Professor," which connects to what's before. The unclear part "mit einem ?" suggests it could mean something marked or labeled. The next part likely reads, "feststellen konnte, habe ich mit einem," though I’m unsure about the exact wording. 

After examining the lower line, it seems to say "richtigstellen wollten, wäre ich sehr." I need to ensure my HTML transcribes this accurately while indicating uncertainty using [unleserlich] for unclear parts. I also want to make it visually appealing with a simple CSS style for spacing and perhaps a light background.
**Transcribing the letter details**

The fifth line says "richtigstellen wollten, wäre ich sehr," confirming "wollten" as correct. The phrase includes "Herr Professor" with "sie" (lowercase) instead of "Sie." This suggests a more informal context. After carefully examining the lines, I've concluded my transcription should be:

"schicke ich beiliegend 3 Literaturangaben,  
Angaben, die ich nicht einwandfrei  
feststellen konnte, habe ich mit einem  
? bezeichnet; wenn sie Herr Professor  
richtigstellen wollten, wäre ich sehr."

Now, I’ll format this into HTML, ensuring to preserve the line breaks and add a touch of styling to make it visually appealing!
