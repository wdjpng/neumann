**Formatting HTML with CSS**

I'm thinking about how to spool everything into HTML, ensuring it looks pretty with CSS. The user asked for "only the HTML code," and I need to include styles that make it resemble a letter on textured paper. To keep the formatting close to the original, I'll preserve line breaks using `<pre>` or perhaps `<br>`. However, using `<pre>` means a monospace font, which isn't ideal. I could opt for `white-space: pre-wrap;` with a font like "Times New Roman" to achieve a better look.
**Choosing HTML Elements for Styling**

I'm considering the best way to wrap lines in HTML. I think using `<div class="letter">` with `<p>` for paragraphs and `<br>` for line breaks could work, but `<pre>` is better for maintaining the exact formatting we need. To mimic handwriting, I'm thinking about styling `<pre>` with fonts like "Segoe Script" or "Lucida Handwriting." I also want to add a paper-like background and a light gray text color for a pencil effect, all while keeping it pretty and adhering closely to the user's formatting requests.
**Crafting HTML Structure**

I'm putting together HTML for a transcription project. It will start with `<html>`, including a `<head>` section with a title and a CSS style block. I want a soothing background color and a central letter format with a delicate gradient, mimicking a vintage look. I'll set padding, line height, and font styling to create a handwritten feel. The `<div class="letter">` section will house the actual text. I also have a hole effect, which might not be necessary, but I want to experiment with it.
**Finalizing HTML and CSS**

I'm wrapping up the HTML code as the user requested to "output only the HTML code." I need to focus on making it pretty and keeping formatting close to the original, including line breaks. I think incorporating a paper-like background with subtle horizontal lines will enhance the look. I can achieve this with a repeating linear gradient. I'll also drop the 'hole' feature since it's not used. For added realism, I might include circle illusions to represent punched holes on the left side of the page, making the design feel even more authentic.
**Producing Final HTML**

I'm finalizing the HTML structure for the transcription task. There's a small round notch near the left that I'm keeping optional, as the goal is to transcribe text, not replicate holes. I'll focus on ensuring the transcription is as accurate as possible, using the correct German diacritics. I'll include important styles to mimic a letter, like a paper background and appropriate fonts. The final code will be clean but visually appealing, and I’ll ensure to include only the necessary HTML elements without any extraneous shapes. Now I’ll deliver the HTML code!
