**Determining page boundaries**

I'm trying to figure out the left page boundary, which might be around x=155. The image shows a page on a grey background, and it seems the page is narrower than the image itself. The grey left margin is maybe around 80 px wide. I need to ensure I'm including the whole width of the letter page. I think my coordinates should be close to the left and right page edges, and it’s fine to include the entire image width to capture everything accurately.
**Deciding chunk segmentation**

I need to include the entire width of each letter page, even if that means capturing some background too. While this is okay, I do see there's a risk of missing additional text near the corners, like "HS 91: 677" at the top left and "Budapest den ..." at the top right. So, including the full width seems best. For segmentation, I must ensure each chunk contains entire lines of text. The lines are slanted, and I'll need to account for that with enough vertical margin. I think I noticed a horizontal fold line near the top that's not text.
**Organizing lines for segmentation**

I’m reviewing the lines for segmentation. At the top left, there’s "HS 91: 677," which is the first line, followed by "Budapest den 25.VII.1925," possibly on the same row. Then there's a notable line, "Sehr geehrter Herr Professor!" which counts as the third line. After a blank line, I see "Die Widersprüchlichkeits-Arbeit..." and more lines that include "schicke ich beiligend," "Angaben, die ich nicht...," and others. I realize I need to group these without exceeding eight lines per chunk. There could indeed be more lines to consider.
**Dividing into chunks**

I’m thinking of dividing the content into three chunks. The first chunk will focus on the header lines, containing about three lines. The second chunk can include around eight lines, and the third chunk will hold the rest, maybe about six lines. I need to ensure that no chunk exceeds eight lines. I’m proposing to vertically segment the page into these sections based on approximate pixel positions, while also including the "fold line." I’ll make sure each chunk fully contains text without crossing into lines. It looks like the topmost text "HS 91: 677" is around y=75.
**Segmenting into chunks**

I’m planning to divide the document into three chunks. The first will start around y=30 and go to y=180, capturing the top header lines and the greeting. The second chunk, from y=181 to about y=430, will cover the first half of the body lines, ensuring to avoid cutting across any lines. The third chunk will cover the remaining lines. I need to be careful about boundaries, ensuring they do not intersect with any text lines, and it might be safer to use fewer chunks to reduce the risk of line cutting.
**Determining chunk boundaries**

I’m identifying the chunk boundaries carefully since there's a fold line around y=368 and another near y=500. The letter has multiple lines after the fold, so I need to ensure I analyze correctly. I need the top boundary at around y=30 to include headers and measure accurately. 

For horizontal coordinates, I’ll set x1 and x2 to capture the entire page width, avoiding any grey margins. I'll set chunk boundaries to ensure there are no text lines being split, proposing:

- Chunk 1: (70, 20, 930, 190)
- Chunk 2: (70, 191, 930, 405)
- Chunk 3: (70, 406, 930, 740) 

This way, I can ensure every line is fully contained within each chunk.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I’m setting the chunk boundaries now: starting with the page top at approximately y=22, I’ll start chunk one at y=20. 

For the boundaries, chunk one will go up to y=200, chunk two from y=201 to y=430, and chunk three will finish at y=750. I’ll choose the horizontal boundaries of x1=60 and x2=940 for the width to ensure I capture the entire letter page. 

The final coordinates will be:
1) Chunk 1: (60, 35, 940, 200)  
2) Chunk 2: (60, 201, 940, 430)  
3) Chunk 3: (60, 431, 940, 750)  

This approach keeps everything neatly organized while maintaining the integrity of each line.
**Finalizing chunk coordinates**

I’m using x1=0 and x2=998 to ensure I capture the entire width of the page. The boundaries I’m adopting are:

1) Chunk 1: (0, 40, 998, 200)  
2) Chunk 2: (0, 201, 998, 430)  
3) Chunk 3: (0, 431, 998, 767)  

This approach ensures I'm not cropping any text at the edges, and it aligns with the instruction to include the whole width of each letter page. The final resolution will be (999, 768). I feel more confident about this setup now!
