**Interpreting HTML representation**

I see a rectangle-like bar over the expression 'V x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2', representing a square root symbol. Traditionally, the radical root is shown with a vertical 'V' and an overbar. In the image, there's a curved line above the expression, so I think I should use the <span> tag with sqrt notation, while also incorporating sup tags for the squared exponents. The user wants a pretty replication of the text and math from the image. I'll consider utilizing <pre> for line breaks and maybe style it with <span class='math'>.
**Analyzing the equation components**

I’m reviewing the second line that starts with 'ds^2 =' followed by a negative sign and 'f(V x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2)' multiplied by '(dx1^2 + dx2^2 + dx3^2)'. The negative sign might refer to part of the metric signature. So, I think it reads 'ds^2 = - f(√x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2)(dx1^2 + dx2^2 + dx3^2) -'. The trailing minus indicates there are unseen terms. The top of the image shows a cropped phrase, "und das," with "wird" visible, but the rest isn’t necessary. Below, I see "c^2 dt^2," but I won’t guess what's cropped; I'll only include visible parts.
**Preparing HTML transcription**

The instruction is clear: "fully transcribe all text in the image," so I need to include everything legible. At the top, I see "wird". The next line reads "ds^2 = - f(√x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2) (dx1^2 + dx2^2 + dx3^2) -". There seems to be an italicized small mark before 'ds^2', and I might also see an 'a' overshadowing.  

For the HTML representation, I’ll use CSS for styling math and incorporate appropriate superscripts and subscripts. I can present 'f(√(x1² + x2² + x3²))' with correct formatting using sup and sub tags.
**Formatting the HTML representation**

For the representation, I’m using 'ds<sup>2</sup> = − f(√(x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>)) (d x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + d x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + d x<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>) −'. 

I’ll aim for handwriting-like spacing and might use <span class="longbar"> for the radical, though it might not be necessary. They want the output to look pretty, so I should focus on replicating the original formatting, including a potential italic script for "wird," which is in German. I’m considering left alignment and possibly a handwritten font. However, I might keep it simple as fonts may not be essential.
**Finalizing HTML output**

I’m getting ready to present 'wird' on one line and then the equation on the next. I’ll keep the trailing minus sign, and I plan to use simple CSS to enhance the equation. The "V" style for the root should be shown with '√'. My HTML will feature a basic container with a handwritten style, and I'll make sure spacing is consistent.

For the final result, I’ll ensure to format everything correctly and replicate the original structure while being mindful of spacing with 'dx' instead of 'd x'. Below is the final HTML code reflecting all those details:
