**Analyzing image resolution**

The figure indicates a resolution of 1046 height by 768 width. I’m considering how to output this as (0..767, 0..1045). The margins might be around 120 px on the left and 770 px on the right. It seems like the image has a background that goes beyond the page's edges, noticeable by the light grey border. So, even though the entire image width is shown, I need to ensure I include the full width of each letter page in reasonable chunks.
**Defining page width**

I understand the instructions say to focus on the letter page, not the entire image width, which includes background. The original pixel coordinate system requires us to define the x1 and x2 coordinates at the edges of the paper. However, this precision might be tricky. So, to be safe, I could consider including the whole image width, though they prefer using only the page width. It seems okay as long as every line is fully contained within a bounding box. The extra background might not be a problem.
**Segmenting content into chunks**

The instructions say to include the whole width of each letter page in my chunks. To achieve that, I need to segment the content into 6-10 chunks filled with dense math lines. Analyzing the content, it starts with a German text line, followed by math variables "x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 mit," then a line break with an equation. Below this, there's more math with a multi-line equation expressing constraints. It might actually count as one expression across four lines, even though it has separate minus terms.
**Maintaining expression integrity**

I need to ensure that I don't split a single mathematical expression across chunks, which means including all lines of that big expression in one chunk. After that, there's a German phrase indicating definitions for functions f, g, and h, followed by three lines of definitions with complex formulas and integrals. It seems like this could group into three equation lines, but it's more than the typical two to four lines limit. I should consider putting them together if it's necessary to keep the expression intact.
**Designing chunk boundaries**

I need to keep the definitions for functions f(x), g(x), and h(x) as separate equation lines, while including any associated integral expressions in the same chunk. There's a subsequent line with another equation, and it looks like I can consider two expressions on one line, especially since they're separated by a semicolon. However, I'll avoid splitting any mathematical expression across chunks! 

Next, I need to analyze the image for y-positions while ensuring each chunk has no more than eight text lines. To achieve this, I’m estimating the margins to set up my bounding boxes to capture the entire width of the text without cropping important elements!
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I need to establish the boundaries for my chunks carefully. I plan to start with a chunk that includes the top lines of text, ensuring not to cut any lines. The first lines are around y=108, so I think I'll set my first chunk from y=90 to y=210 for safety.

As I analyze further, I see the next important text with a multi-line equation. It makes sense to keep essential elements together while adhering to the "two to four lines" limit. I also need to visually inspect the image for better approximations. Ultimately, I'll end up with six manageable chunks that include all related text and math without splitting crucial expressions.
**Setting chunk boundaries**

I need to ensure my y boundaries for the chunks are accurate, avoiding any overflow. I want to capture the last lines of text, setting y2 to about 1015, while allowing for some margin.

I’ll set x1 to 50 and x2 to 720 to incorporate the entire width of the page comfortably. Since I have to be cautious about overlapping boundaries, I'm thinking a slight vertical overlap might help avoid splitting expressions. I'll also aim for some overlap between chunks to ensure every line of text is captured. This planning is crucial to maintain clarity in each chunk without excess lines getting mixed.
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I’m proposing the y boundaries for each chunk now. For instance, Chunk 1 is set from y1=95 to y2=240, and I'll continue defining them up until Chunk 6 at y2=1008. I must ensure we include all relevant text, especially for big sections like the ds^2 block, adjusting the boundaries accordingly.

I'll also double-check that each chunk captures all text lines accurately without splitting any equations. Finally, I’ll set the boundaries to ensure they encompass the whole width of the page, fine-tuning as needed for visibility.
**Finalizing chunk adjustments**

I’m working on refining the chunk segmentation, aiming to produce six well-defined chunks around the uncertain boundaries. I've considered equations in each chunk to ensure we don’t exceed the limits for mathematical expressions. For example, Chunk 1 has one equation, while Chunk 4 holds three. 

I’m also adjusting the y-coordinates for better accuracy. I believe I should set the first chunk’s top to y1=70 to capture any potential content above it and finalize the last line resolution. 

Now it’s time to double-check that every line of text or math is fully contained within its designated chunk.
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I'm making adjustments to ensure the vertical extents are accurate. I need to widen each chunk's vertical range to avoid cutting off any lines, but I risk including too many lines. It's okay if chunk 1 includes part of the adjacent line since the eight-line constraint allows it. I’ll also adjust the width of the chunks to ensure I cover the entire letter page. 

After several tweaks, I’ll finalize the coordinate pairs and confirm that everything fits within the designated limits. Now, I’m ready to present the final output.
