**Designing HTML structure**

I’ll start by structuring it with a `<div class="letter">`, using a paper-like background, even if it’s not totally necessary since they want only the HTML code. I’ll add a `<html>` tag and relevant meta and style elements. To create a handwritten feel, I’m considering using cursive fonts and ensuring the first line has spacing. I’ll also define a `<div class="content">` with a white background. They want to maintain line breaks, so I’ll use `<p>` tags or `<br>`. I need to balance visual appeal with their requests.
**Maintaining original formatting**

It's crucial to keep the formatting as close to the original as possible, including line breaks. For the hyphenation, I'll ensure that "Antipo-" appears correctly at the end of line 2 and at the start of line 3 with "den." 

I'll start with `<div class="ps">P. S.</div>` and add a small left margin for indents. The lines will follow as given, with attention to maintaining the original characters. I’ll note that "Lösung" may need to be spelled with "ö." I have to figure out the line breaks and how to structure it all clearly.
**Refining line four**

For line 4, I’m examining it closely: it reads "stets zwei Antipoden x1, x2, x3, xr und -x1, -x2, -x3, -xr zu." I need to check the sequence for accuracy. I'll adjust the formatting to use ellipsis "…" rather than guessing with symbols. 

To enhance readability, I'll apply subscript markup: "x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, …, x<sub>r</sub> und −x<sub>1</sub>, −x<sub>2</sub>, −x<sub>3</sub>, …, −x<sub>r</sub> zu." It seems necessary to manage line breaks carefully, especially since the variable line is long. I’ll continue with "identifizieren." at the far left in line 5.
**Finalizing line structure**

I realize that line 4 should end with the enumeration and "zu." Based on the image, it looks like "zu" is the last word there, followed by "identifizieren." starting the next line. 

It confirms that "zu" indeed needs to be at the end of line 4, creating a line break before "identifizieren." I also need to double-check the hyphenation at the end of line 2 with "Antipo-." So, the final lines will be:

1: "P. S."  
2: "Ich weiß nicht wie die Symmetrie der Antipo-"  
3: "den zu deuten ist."
**Verifying final content**

I want to make sure I’m checking everything carefully. I should include the accent in "weiß" and confirm the spelling of "Symmetrie" with an uppercase 'S.' The spacing after "x<sub>r</sub> und" needs to be consistent. 

Now, "P. S." is fine to keep. However, there's something about the embedding overshadow ring that I can’t replicate, so let’s summarize: "I don't know how to interpret the symmetry of the antipodes; the most radical solution would be to always identify two antipodes..." 

Now, I'll finalize and make sure to provide only the HTML code, keeping everything as required.
