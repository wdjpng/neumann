**Examining image cropping**

I'm looking at cropping an image where the width is large but the height is small. There's a partially cut line at the top left, possibly from a preceding line that starts with “wird dieser Raum N4, φ, t auf den Raum der.” I'm unsure if we should include that faint part. 

In the center, there’s a line of variables, followed by a formula: "x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 - x5^2 = 1." Then, there's some German text referencing "das de Sitter'sche Hyperboloid." I want to examine this text more closely to ensure accuracy.
**Reviewing text details**

I’m examining the line of text that includes "(das de Sittersche Hyperboloid) abgebildet, d.h. auf seinen," and I’m debating whether it might be "auf seinen." 

The next part shows "Teil mit x1^2 + x2^2 + ..., ≤ 1," but it cuts off beyond that. I’ll look at the image again to clarify: the formula "x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 - x5^2 = 1" is visible. I see more about the de Sitter hyperboloid, but it’s partially cropped, so I need to check that section closely to fully understand it.
**Transcribing visible text**

I need to accurately transcribe the visible text in the image. Starting from the top left, I see "x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 mit." There’s a preceding line that starts with "wird dieser Raum , v φ, t ...", but I'll avoid the topmost text that's partly visible. However, I still feel it's essential to include everything I can read from the cut-off text. I see parts like "wird dieser Raum N4, φ, t ...", so I’ll need to check the image again for clarity.
**Clarifying visible text**

I’m zooming in on the image. The phrase "wird dieser Raum" is clear, and I see letters like "N4, φ1." It might also include "N, ψ, φ, t," indicating another language. The context seems to discuss mapping a space onto five variables: x1 to x5. 

The phrase "wird dieser Raum N4, φ, t auf den Raum der" is visible, but not essential. I need to focus on the central lines I can confirm, particularly the independent top line starting with "x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 mit." I’ll ensure to include everything legible from the image while excluding any partially cut lines.
**Planning HTML transcription**

I need to be careful about transcribing the visible text accurately. The top line might not be fully visible, but the instructions say to "fully transcribe all text." I can use ellipses for parts we can't decipher, but I'll avoid guessing anything.

For example, I can write out "wird dieser Raum N?, φ, φ, t ..." as best as I can, and center the main equation and variable lines. I will also ensure to use proper HTML formatting with appropriate tags for subscripts and superscripts.

Finally, I’ll tidy up the structure using CSS to make it look nice while keeping it simple. Let’s get started on this!
**Designing HTML structure**

I’m working on creating a centered equation for the HTML, with the formula for the Hyperboloid neatly formatted. The line "das de Sitter’sche Hyperboloid" needs careful transcription since the text shows slight variations. I can replicate it as "das de Sitter’sche Hyperboloid".

For the equations involving subscripts and superscripts, I'll use proper HTML tags to ensure everything displays correctly. Spacing will be maintained with CSS for a light aesthetic while keeping it minimal.

Overall, I'll structure it carefully, ensuring clarity and visual appeal without overwhelming formatting! Let's finalize this.
