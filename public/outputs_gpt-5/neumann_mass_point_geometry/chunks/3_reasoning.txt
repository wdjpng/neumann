**Creating styled HTML**

I'm thinking it's better to create HTML using sup tags for superscripts and consider using actual Greek letters instead of spans. The instructions say to "Make it pretty!" but I noticed there’s no header to replicate. I should style it simply while ensuring line breaks are preserved. Using a <pre> tag can help, but I also want to add superscripts without losing HTML functionality. Maybe it’s safer to use <div> tags with <span> for the formatting. Let's go with that.
**Clarifying equation details**

I need to include the line "Wenn 0 < m < 1/ ..." as part of the second line. I should examine the scribble closely and zoom in. The second line starts with a plus sign, which may connect to the first line. It has "1 - 2m/r - r^2" followed by "dt^2" with a dot at the end. Given the position of the plus sign, it seems like the second line continues the equation. However, I'm wondering if "Wenn 0 < m < 1/2k" belongs elsewhere, not as part of this equation.
**Interpreting the scribbled equation**

I notice that "Wenn" is scribbled near the left margin, just below the plus sign. It seems to indicate "Wenn 0 < m < 1/2k" but the cropping of the image only shows part of it as "Wenn 0 < m < 1/(2?)". There’s likely more text visible to the right that's cut off. The plus sign at the start of the second line is also to the right of the "Wenn" text. So, the top line continues the equation after the plus sign, but "Wenn 0 < m ..." appears somewhat overshadowed.
**Transcribing the text**

The task requires me to transcribe all text in the image, which means I need to include the "Wenn..." snippet. I see at the bottom left, "Wenn" is clearly spelled out. Then, it seems to say "0 < m < 1/", but I'm unsure about what follows. Maybe it says "1/2k" or something with a square root. The context seems to be metrics related to ds^2 and de Sitter space with mass m. The general metric appears to be ds^2 = - A(r)^-1 dr^2 - r^2 dθ^2 - r^2 sin^2 θ dφ^2 + A(r) dt^2, where A(r) = 1 - 2m/r - r^2.
**Transcribing mathematical text**

It looks like this relates to anti-de Sitter space with a negative cosmological constant. I want to include the "Wenn..." snippet properly. The fraction seems to start with "1" over something like "2√k," but it’s hard to discern. The instructions say to transcribe all text and if anything is unsure, I can mark it as [unreadable]. I can also replicate ambiguous parts if needed. 

I’ll create a simple HTML format using superscripts and appropriate Greek lettering, ensuring it’s neat and meets the guidelines provided!
**Crafting the HTML equation**

I need to create the HTML representation of the equation while keeping the format as close to the original scribble as possible. I'm focusing on using serif fonts and including Greek letters for θ and φ correctly. I want to ensure I'm including fractions, superscripts, and proper line breaks.

I'll keep the three lines for clarity: the main equation, the continuation with dt², and the "Wenn..." snippet. To address uncertainty in transcription, I may note ambiguous parts with "[unreadable]." I aim to make it visually appealing while adhering to the instructions regarding formatting limitations. Let's finalize this!
