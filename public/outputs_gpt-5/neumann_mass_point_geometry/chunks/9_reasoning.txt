**Crafting a styled text display**

I'm considering how to style the text effectively. We can use HTML `<span>` for textual notations and format the main line, like "Daß f,g,h für x> r0 / r1 (?) endlich und positiv sind ist ohne weiteres klar; für g(x) folgt dies aus der Dar-stellung." The spelling "Daß" feels odd, but that's okay. To give it a handwritten look, I think using CSS with cursive fonts could work. We have to preserve line breaks and formulas, so I’m thinking we could use `<pre>` or `<div>` with `<br>` tags for clarity.
**Designing a styled letter format**

I'm thinking we should create a wrapper `<div class="letter">` to style the background with an aged paper color. They didn’t request background images, so I'll keep it simple. We can make an "equation-line" using either `<div>` or `<span>`. Since the notation is a bit uncertain, maybe we can present it with image-like styling. 

As for the HTML, I want to set up proper font styles for readability while ensuring the formatting isn’t too heavy. They asked to "Make it pretty," so I'll focus on clarity and aesthetics!
**Clarifying the text interpretation**

I just noticed that the word "stellung" is visible at the bottom-left of the image, despite being overshadowed by cropping. This indicates the previous line actually ended with the hyphen "aus der Dar-", not with a period. I initially mistook a small character for a period, but it seems it might be a hyphen instead. With "stellung" starting the next line, it's clear that we have a hyphenated word transition. 

So, the main lines are:
Line 1: "Daß f, g, h für x > r0/ri endlich und positiv sind ist"
Line 2: "ohne weiteres klar, für g(x) folgt dies aus der Dar-"
Line 3: "stellung."
**Choosing notation for variables**

I'm trying to figure out the correct notation for 'ri'. Should it be 'r_1'? To keep it consistent, I’ll set it as 'r_1' in the math, so something like "r_0 over r_1" makes sense. We might transcribe it as 'r0' and 'r1' for clarity. 

To replicate precisely, I can format the fraction as "r0/r1" with 'r0' as the numerator and 'r1' as the denominator. Since I noticed the expression "x > r0/ri," I have to decide whether to prefer 'r1' or 'r_i'. To keep it straightforward, I'll use "r0/r1." Let's go with that!
