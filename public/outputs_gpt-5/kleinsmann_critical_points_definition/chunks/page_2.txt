**Analyzing page content**

I'm looking at a page where the top half has content and the bottom half is mostly blank, apart from some fold lines. It seems the text starts around y=90 and goes to y=520. I need to mentally scan and approximate the bounding Y values.

The writing begins at around y=90 or 100, and the first few lines are continuous text up to around y=260. After that, there are math lines with enumerations like E0, E1, etc. I'll make sure to capture each full line in the bounding boxes, considering their slight slant.
**Defining boundaries for content**

I'm focusing on how to include the entire text width while determining the y1 and y2 boundaries for full lines with margins. I'm approximating the height at about 957 pixels.

The top margin above the first line appears to be around 60 pixels. For the text block, I suggest it goes from y  95 to 215, which should cover the first few lines. 

I notice the top line is German, starting with "Bemerkungen die...", followed by more lines of text. After careful counting, we can define the boundaries for chunk 1 to include the top header lines, maybe 4 to 5 lines in total.
**Setting boundaries for math lines**

I'm going to set the boundaries at y1=80 and y2=220. For chunk 2, I need to focus on the math group lines, which may include two small lines like E0 and equals signs.

When I look at the picture, there's a middle line with "E0 ε0" appearing in a sequence. The line after that mentions "dargestellt... V ER (Zeile?)" and includes an underbrace.

I notice there's a German line: "Übrigens ist sie hier nicht als Linie der Folge," followed by numbers like E0 and E1, along with some Greek letters. The next line again contains "dargestellt... sondern als eines der Folge" with parentheses and possibly another line with E0 in braces.
**Identifying math lines for chunks**

I suspect there might be three lines of math. The first line features an E0 sequence, while the second describes "dargestellt...". However, there’s a guideline to keep chunks to two to four lines of mathematical expressions unless necessary for a big expression. Including text lines with math is okay too, but we should limit the equations per chunk.

I notice at least two lines showing arrays of E0, possibly with curly braces. There’s also a bottom line with "E0 E1 E2...". In the middle, I clearly see two lines of "E0 E1 ε...", and I need to check if they have curly braces around them.
**Refining chunk boundaries**

I see there are large curly braces in the math sections with phrases like "dargestellt ist die" and "nicht 2 fall, sondern elastines der folge." I need to set chunk 2 to include the math expression lines alongside the descriptive text but keep it within 2 to 4 math lines.

Let's propose chunk boundaries: 

- **Chunk 2:** from y=220 to y=355 with 2 math lines and 1 text line.
- **Chunk 3:** follows with 4-5 lines of text.
- **Chunk 4:** closing lines near y=470-530.

I’ll ensure each line falls completely within one chunk, adding generous margins. By analyzing the image details, I plan to set precise y boundaries and use full width while keeping some guidelines in mind for proper coverage without cutting into text lines.
**Finalizing chunk boundaries**

I'm working on setting chunk boundaries carefully to avoid cutting across lines. I can ensure there are generous spaces between the chunks. To refine these:

- **Chunk 1:** y1=70, y2=235.
- **Chunk 2:** y1=236, y2=370, which includes the two math lines and a descriptive text line.
- **Chunk 3:** y1=371, y2=470 for subsequent text lines.
- **Chunk 4:** y1=471, y2=560 for closing lines.

I’ll ensure the coordinates are integers, ranging correctly within the width of the image while accounting for any necessary margins. The final output will precisely follow the specified format for parsing.
I'm finalizing the chunk boundaries with careful consideration. To ensure coverage, I'm using these coordinates:

- **Chunk 1:** (0, 70, 767, 240)
- **Chunk 2:** (0, 241, 767, 400) — this includes two math lines, which is good.
- **Chunk 3:** (0, 401, 767, 480)
- **Chunk 4:** (0, 481, 767, 560)

I've set the resolution to (768, 957). I’m making sure that no lines fall between chunks and maintaining overlaps as necessary. This gives me confidence that the text and expressions are fully contained within the defined areas. Let’s finalize this!
I'm finalizing the coordinates for chunking the text while ensuring we don't exceed eight lines per chunk. The numbers look good, and I've set:

- **Chunk 1:** (0, 80, 767, 240)
- **Chunk 2:** (0, 241, 767, 410)
- **Chunk 3:** (0, 411, 767, 485)
- **Chunk 4:** (0, 486, 767, 560)

The resolution is (768, 957). I also made sure to keep the text lines entirely contained in each bounding box, which should satisfy all requirements. I’m feeling confident about the output now!
