**Transcribing text to HTML**

I need to transcribe text into HTML format while ensuring I preserve the original formatting. There’s an image of a letterhead that includes both printed and handwritten text, and I’ll include everything I can read. I want to replicate the header beautifully, with typography that captures the left and right columns. The header states "HAUSVERWALTUNG HOHENZOLLERNSTRASSE NR. 23/24," and then I see some bank details and date information. There are also telephone lines and some handwritten notes I need to decode. Let's make it look nice!
**Transcribing details accurately**

I’m working on transcribing more text for the HTML. The left header has "BANK-KONTO: DEUTSCHE BANK U. DISCONTO-GES. DEPOSITEN-KASSE K2" which may have a little confusion around "K2." The address reads "BERLIN W 35, LÜTZOWSTRASSE 33-36," and I see that’s printed correctly in the image. On the right side, it says "BERLIN W10, DEN 12.6.1933, Montag," and the handwriting is slanted, so I’ll represent that using a script-style format to highlight it. Let's make sure everything is just right!
**Transcribing contact information**

Now I'm focusing on the telephone numbers listed under "TEL.: B 2 LÜTZOW 31 16, 31 86, 31 87, B 1 KURFÜRST 23 68." After taking a closer look, the printed version seems to read "TEL.: B 2 LÜTZOW 3116, 3186, 3187; B 1 KURFÜRST 2368." The digits seem to be separated by commas, and I want to make sure we transcribe this accurately while confirming the high-resolution details. There’s also an important line that reads "NACH ERÖFFNUNG DES SELBSTANSCHLUSSBETRIEBES LÜTZOW," which should be underlined. I’ll keep going to ensure I get everything right!
**Clarifying additional numbers**

I see the line "SAMMEL-NR. B 2 LÜTZOW 9141," and then it continues with "UND B 2 LÜTZOW 5039, 8137, 8116, 9145." I need to double-check these numbers: maybe I see "5039, 8137, 3116, 9145" instead? The digits look tricky—it's hard to tell if it's "3116” or "8116." It seems consistent that “3116” pops up again, especially with the earlier numbers. I think I'll go with "3116" for accuracy, as it fits better with previous findings. Let's make sure to get this just right!
