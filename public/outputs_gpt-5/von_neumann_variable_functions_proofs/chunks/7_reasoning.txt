**Deciphering text challenges**

I’m considering how to handle text that's difficult to read. The instructions say to fully transcribe all text, but if it's illegible, I should use a placeholder. Since I can’t rotate the image, I'll mentally flip it to decipher the mirrored writing. It’s faint, but I’ll look for words. I see fragments like “die ... sind” and “die ... Toten,” possibly relating to something about Germans. There are other hints too, and it feels tricky!
**Handling text presentation**

Wait a second: I spotted the Roman numeral "II," and there's maybe “II -” at the bottom center left. It could be something like “Vs in II -,” but it’s really challenging to decipher. The best plan seems to be creating an HTML page that displays the faint italic text. However, since we need to fully transcribe what's in the image, if it’s not clear, I can use “[illegible].” I'll set up the HTML with styled containers, showing what I can while being honest about the unreadable parts.
**Transcribing partially readable text**

I think I can make out some words like "die," "und," "in," and a few Roman numerals like "II" and "III." Instead of fabricating anything, I prefer to use spans with “[illegible]” for the unreadable sections, as the text isn’t in English. I’ll create an HTML that keeps the line breaks using a `<pre>` block. They want a nice look, so I’ll add a styled paper background with CSS. Finally, I’ll make sure to indicate unreadable parts with “[illegible].”
**Examining text extraction**

The Roman numerals "II" and "III" might be included, but I want to keep formatting light, as they mentioned, "Make it pretty." I see something like "die [something] toten" at the center-right near the top, but the handwriting slants left and is quite faint. I think it’s more effective to note that we have "Lines of faint mirrored handwriting, mostly illegible." I’ll declare a `<pre>` block with about 15 lines, capturing the essence of what's visible in the letter.
**Creating HTML for transcription**

I’ll create an HTML document including about 16 lines with “[illegible]” and some Roman numerals like "II" and "III." I want to keep the formatting consistent and avoid extra text. Each line will reference the text as mostly unreadable, preserving line breaks. For styling, I’ll use a `<pre>` block to maintain spacing, with a font that looks like handwritten text. I’ll also add visual cues for the faint lines and include a note about the presence of mirrored handwriting. Let’s wrap it all up neatly in the final HTML code.
