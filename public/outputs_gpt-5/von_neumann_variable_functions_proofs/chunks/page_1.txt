**Clarifying image resolution**

I'm looking into the proper format for the output resolution based on the instruction. The test harness shows "resolution 985 768," which suggests height of 985 px and width of 768 px. The alt text seems to confirm this. I need to define chunks as the page has a vertical orientation, and I’m thinking about creating 6-8 horizontal chunks while ensuring that each chunk is full width. I need to keep equations manageable as well.
**Analyzing mathematical notation**

I'm examining some math-like notations in the second line that starts with “Beweis der Wald...”. I see a few mathematical elements like sequences and some formulas, but nothing too complex. For instance, “I.-XI.” isn’t heavy math. However, there's an equation with brackets and parentheses that might indicate a long formula line. The instructions say not to exceed two to four lines of math expressions per chunk, so I should separate them if possible to maintain clarity.
**Structuring text into chunks**

I need to make sure that every line of text or mathematical expression is fully contained within one chunk. This means I can't split a line across two chunks, which seems to follow a typical segmentation approach. I'm thinking it would be best to create about 7-8 horizontal chunks that each contain 6-8 lines or fewer, keeping in mind not to overload them with equations. I’ll need to inspect the image closely to approximate the lines since the handwriting makes precise counting difficult. The top part includes some letterhead text and small margins, which will form my first chunk.
**Analyzing the content structure**

I need to include the greeting and probably some formulas afterward. So, I'll mentally visualize the image, focusing on specific areas. There’s a blank top margin with a light scribble, followed by the printed header text at the top. I’ll include that in the first chunk. Then, from y 220 to 300, I see the salutation line starting with "Lieber Herr Professor..." which might contain some math notations. After that, from y 310 to 350, there's a long formula line that looks like a derived formula, which will need its own chunk.
**Segmenting the content into chunks**

I see that from y 355 to 525, there are several handwriting lines describing the method, including some enumerated sections. I should treat the potential formulas cautiously, as I can only have 2-4 lines of expressions in one chunk. I'll create separate chunks for formulas and the text around them. For Chunk 1, I'll include the header and stop before the first handwritten line. In Chunk 2, I’ll focus on the salutation and surrounding text, while Chunk 3 will only contain the formula line. The following chunks will cover the additional lines of text ensuring I don’t exceed the limits set for text per chunk. I’ll make sure to find appropriate boundaries to ensure complete lines are included without cutting any off.
**Determining chunk boundaries**

I see there might be an enumerated list of formulas, but they won't take up full lines. Given that, I can proceed with 6 or 7 total chunks. The instructions say I can use up to ten chunks to split expressions neatly. For chunking, I've decided on several segments: Chunk 1 for the header, then I’ll include blocks for the text, the formula line, and additional text. I need to ensure each chunk contains no more than 8 lines and that boundaries don't cut any text. It’s crucial every single line must be fully contained in one chunk, so I’ll pick boundaries wisely, focusing on whitespace and typical line spacing to guide my choices. Let's set the precise boundaries to avoid cutting any essential details.
**Refining chunk boundaries**

To ensure I don’t risk splitting lines, I should adjust my chunk boundaries carefully. The pre-formula chunk ends at y2=320, but the last line might fall close to 315, so merging them could be safer. I can combine the last text line with the formula line since there's only one formula to manage. I'll set up my chunks as follows: Chunk 1 for the header, Chunk 2 to include all text leading up to the formula, Chunk 3 for the subsequent lines, and so on. This way, each chunk maintains the required line count without cutting off text. I'll confirm my final coordinate pairs to ensure clarity and compliance.
**Finalizing coordinate boundaries**

I need to ensure that I don’t overload chunks with too many lines while keeping them under 8. I’m setting up my x-coordinate range from 0 to 767, including the whole width of the letter page without capturing outside backgrounds. I’ll propose the following coordinate pairs to maintain clarity and ensure that no lines are cut off: 

- (0, 0, 767, 240)
- (0, 240, 767, 390)
- (0, 390, 767, 535)
- (0, 535, 767, 680)
- (0, 680, 767, 825)
- (0, 825, 767, 984)

I’ll double-check that all values are valid integers, and each chunk satisfies the requirement of fully containing all text lines.
**Finalizing coordinates for chunks**

I think the formatting needs to be precise. I’ll set the coordinates to ensure no content gets cut off, choosing 767 for width and 984 for height. Since six chunks fit the requirement of two to ten, that's perfect!

I'll format the pairs like this:

(0, 0, 767, 240)  
(0, 240, 767, 390)  
(0, 390, 767, 535)  
(0, 535, 767, 680)  
(0, 680, 767, 825)  
(0, 825, 767, 984)  
(768, 985)  

Everything is in place, and I'm good to go!
