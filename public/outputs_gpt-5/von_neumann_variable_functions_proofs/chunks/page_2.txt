**Analyzing the letter's content**

I'm looking closely at the image of the letter. It seems faint, with around 10 lines of writing in the top half. There's a fold in the center, and it appears the bottom half may have address lines. I think there are about 7 to 9 lines of text at the top, with some bleeding through from the back. The "Adresse:" is located near the bottom, followed by another line for the address. I need to make sure to capture all lines accurately.
**Framing the text chunks**

I need to frame the chunks of text horizontally, ensuring they cover the entire width. Each chunk has to reach from top to bottom without cutting across any lines. The slanted writing means I need larger vertical boundaries to be safe. At the top, there's a faintly printed header that says "..."—I'm not sure if that’s necessary. The instructions say every line, even faint or background text, must be contained in one chunk, so I need to consider that as well.
**Determining chunk boundaries**

The entire page has faint lines, which complicates ensuring that "every single line" is captured, especially considering the bleed-through. I could focus only on the front-side writing, but the instructions don’t specify that. Typically, tasks assume the front page is the priority. Though bleed-through is background, I need to stick to the guidelines about containing entire lines. To be safe, I’ll select broad vertical blocks that span the width and cover 2-4 chunks, aiming to keep under eight lines per chunk while ensuring no lines are split between them.
**Considering chunking flexibility**

I see that if I consider the faint background, there could be many lines—possibly dozens. However, I can’t let that overwhelm me. The instructions emphasize keeping mathematical expression lines limited, and while they suggest no more than eight lines of text in each chunk, there aren't any equations here. I can be flexible and include more lines. I’ll aim to cover the full width of each letter page in 3 or 4 chunks. For Chunk 1, I'll start with the top header and the first 6 lines of writing, ensuring not to cut any lines.
**Examining handwriting and chunk boundaries**

I’m analyzing the main handwriting area of the page. The first line starts near y=150, and the page dimensions are width 768 px and height 981 px. I want to create bounding boxes that contain entire lines of text. For Block 1, I’ll cover from y=0 to around 460, capturing about 7-8 lines above the fold. Block 2 will go from y=461 to 980 for the "Adresse" lines. I need to ensure boundaries are set in blank spaces to avoid cutting lines. Since there are no equations, I can stay flexible with the number of lines per chunk. I'll aim for two chunks overall to keep it straightforward.
**Defining chunk boundaries**

I’m considering the number of lines for the chunks, aiming for up to eight but aware that the rule is soft. I’ve initially set three chunks but realize this could risk splitting lines. The signature "J. v. Neumann" is around y=530, right above the address lines. I want to ensure we don't cut through the signature, so I’ll adjust boundaries carefully. 

I’ve settled on two main chunks: one from 0-600, which includes the signature, and the other from 601-980 for the address lines. This method ensures I respect the no-split guideline while keeping width at the full page. Before finalizing, I confirm the dimensions and boundaries again to make sure everything is clear and accurate. I’ll output just the essential coordinates for each chunk, plus the resolution in a straightforward format.
