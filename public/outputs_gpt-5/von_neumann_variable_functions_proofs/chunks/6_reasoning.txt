**Transcribing letter text**

I need to transcribe all visible text from the image to HTML, while keeping formatting and line breaks intact. The letter is in German, with a faint letterhead that might say "HA[?]STENWALDUNG HOHENZOLLERNSTRASSE," but I'm not entirely sure. It's important to capture everything, including faint text due to bleed-through. The main visible text begins, "Entschuldigen Sie bitte, dass ich mich am Sonnabend nicht mehr gemeldet habe," which seems plausible. The next part mentions returning notes since there’s no copy available.
**Transcribing letter details**

I see the text, "Adresse: Budapest, I., Arany János ucca 16," but the letter shows it slightly differently. I should be careful about identifying real people, but that’s not necessary here. The signature seems to be from "J. v. Neumann," which I can include since OCR transcription allows it. I need to create pure HTML that replicates the formatting. There's a faint letterhead that might say "Hastenwaldung Hohenzollernstrasse," and I need to capture only the legible parts while maintaining the original style and line breaks.
**Transcribing handwritten lines**

I’m trying to read the faint text that might say "HAUPTVERWALTUNG HOHENZOLLERNSTRASSE," but I won’t guess—just focus on what’s clear. The handwritten lines start with, "Entschuldigen Sie bitte, dass ich mich am Sonnabend nicht mehr gemeldet habe," which flows into "ich musste aber noch 4 weitere Besuche machen," with "4" clearly visible. The next part indicates being grateful for returning notes, even though there's some scribbling. It ends with "Mit den besten Grüßen Ihr" followed by the signature "J. v. Neumann," which has some spacing and a flourish above it.
**Examining address details**

I see a decorative curved line above the signature "J. v. Neumann," and beneath that, there's "Adresse:" underlined. Then it reads "Budapest, I., Arany János ucca 16." The image might show a misspelling with "Adresze:" instead. The "u." stands for "utca," which seems to suggest an older Hungarian style. The letter shows "ucca" with a repeat 'c'. I need to confirm if "I" is actually "V," as it could denote the district, leading me to think it's "Budapest - V."
**Preparing HTML for transcription**

I'm noticing that the letter shows a shape for "I" that could actually be "V," which indicates the district in Budapest. The address reads "Budapest, V., Arany János ucca 16," and it's important to include it accurately, alongside the emblematic header. The header seems to reference "HAUPTVERWALTUNG HOHENZOLLERNSTRASSE." I need to ensure I transcribe everything clearly into HTML while keeping formatting intact.

I’ll include handwritten styles and a decorative flourish over the signature, ensuring proper German punctuation and spacing so that it looks aesthetically pleasing.
**Crafting HTML for transcription**

I noticed that the word "eigenen" has a strikethrough, which I should replicate using the `<s>` tag, forming "meine <s>eigenen</s> Noten." Now, I'll put together the HTML structure for the letter with proper spacing and line breaks. 

This includes using `<br>` for breaks and a swirling line above the signature with `<svg>`. I’ll focus on keeping styling minimal, following instructions to make it pretty but not overwhelming. 

The final HTML will include all necessary details and diacritics while ensuring everything is exact and clearly formatted.
